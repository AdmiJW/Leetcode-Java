/*
 * 	It is asking us to find the number of different bits between the two numbers. This question is bit manipulation question
 * 	An approach is to use a mask of single bit of state 1, and each time AND operation on the two numbers
 * (If bit is 0, it returns 0, else it returns 1)
 *  If the AND result isn't same, then that means this bit is different and we should increment the counter by 1
 *  Since integer is guarenteed to be in size 32 bit, then we just run through it 31 times, initially as 1.
 *  
 *  Another idea is to XOR the two numbers. Remember XOR only returns true if the bits are different. Afterwards we'll just count the number of 1 in the resulting
 *  XOR solution
 *  
 *  Also, you can use the right shift of bitwise operation on the XOR result. Right shifting causes the rightmost bits to be shifted away.
 *  By starting at i = 0, we will test the bit is on or off by AND it with 1. This is about the above two ideas combined
 *
