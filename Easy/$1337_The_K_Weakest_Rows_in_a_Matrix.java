/*
 * Generally when we see the Kth smallest or Kth largest, it is a good idea to use Heap, since it allows us to
 * use only K spaces.
 * 
 * Traverse through the matrices row by row. We can get the power of each row by following:
 * 	>	Naive counting - O(N) where N is number of elements in a row
 * 	>	Binary search - O(Log N) since every army is at front
 * 
 * Then, store them as pair of index:value so that index can be compared in case power is same in the heap. The heap
 * will handle the sorting
 * Once heap size exceeded K, pop out the useless value, which is largest one. Therefore we'll use max heap for the job
 * 
 * 	If use binary Search n heap, time will be O(M log N) where M is row, and N is col. If use linear scan, then it is 
 * 	O(MN) instead.
 * 	Space is maintained in O(K)
