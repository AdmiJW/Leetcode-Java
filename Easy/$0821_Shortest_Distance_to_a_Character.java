/*
 * 	This is a Array problem, potentially usage of Queue, but optimized solution don't use it
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	For each character in string, the closest character c may come from the left, or the right. Therefore, we
 * 	need this information for efficient processing.
 * 
 * 	To obtain this information, notice this: We have to discard away indices that are already far away from current
 * 	position. Data structures like stack and queue immediately comes to mind.
 * 
 * 	Therefore, first iteration records the indices of character c into the queue. Then, in second iteration, we hold
 * 	a previous indice of character c, and keep comparing with top of queue. If right side character is closer (top of
 * 	queue), we poll (update) and discard away the left index of character c.
 * 
 * 	Worst case space complexity is O(N) if the string is entirely character c.
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	As said, character c may come from left or right. Therefore, split the problem into smaller ,easier to solve
 * 	subproblems:
 * 
 * 		>	Shortest distance to a character STRICTLY FROM LEFT SIDE ONLY
 * 		>	Shortest distance to a character STRICTLY FROM RIGHT SIDE ONLY
 * 
 * 	Take the minimum from these 2 solutions, we will get global solution.
