/*
 * 	This is a Binary Search Tree DFS (Inorder traversal) Problem. Surprisingly, it seems to be easier implemented
 * 	iterative than recursively, using Stack.
 * 
 * 	Given Binary Search Tree, we want to reorder them so that root node is minimum node and the right node points to
 * 	next minimum larger node. Remember this is like finding sorted list in BST, thus inorder traversal algorithm comes
 * 	into mind.
 * 
 * 	Using Stack, we would place the nodes to be explored later. Why we would want to explore a node later? because there
 * 	is a smaller node at left subtree.
 * 	Therefore, when facing a node:
 * 	
 * 		If the node has left subtree:
 * 			Push current node into Stack
 * 			Push left node into Stack so it is explored first before current node
 * 			Remove current node's left pointer so it no longer points to left subtree to prevent revisiting
 * 
 * 		Now, otherwise the node has no left subtree:
 * 			Append current node to the tail of resulting 'list'
 * 			If the node has a right subtree, push right node into Stack
 * 
 * 	And that's it!
 * 
 * 	==============================================================================================
 * 
 * 	THe recursion algorithm is just like Stack implementation above. Each recursion call we pass in the tail node so the node
 * 	can be easily append to it.
 * 
 * 	Each recursion call should return the updated pointer so it can be easily updated in the parent call.
 * 
 * 	Therefore, in each recursion call,
 * 			If the node passed is null, return the tail pointer untouched
 * 			Otherwise, first recurse on the left subtree. Once returned the updated pointer, set the current call's
 * 			tail pointer to the updated one
 * 			Then, append the current node to the tail's right. Move the tail to point to current node.
 * 			Then, recurse on right subtree. Since it returns the updated pointer, return the recursion return value.
