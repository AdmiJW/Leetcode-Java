/*
 * 	A HashMap is simply an array, but to access an element, we use what is called as 'keys', which
 * 	must be hashable, like Strings (in Java, every object is hashable).
 * 
 * 	Now, A HashMap has an array of fixed size to store elements, as well as a hashing function, which
 * 	maps keys to the indices of the array. With that, all elements can be accessed in approximated O(1)
 * 	time!
 * 
 * 	Collision may happen, where 2 different keys will be hashed into the very same index. In that case,
 * 	a collision is said to be happened, and it has to be resolved.
 * 	One of such way to resolve, is to use Linkedlist. Instead of storing one element in each index, it
 * 	stores linked list, so when collision happens, it will only add elements to the linked list. of course,
 * 	the data structure should be optimized to have collision occur as little as possible.
