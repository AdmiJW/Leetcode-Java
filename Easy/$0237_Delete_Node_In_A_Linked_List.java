/*
 * 	The question said that remove the given node without reference to its parent.
 * 	The key is to realize that the node MUST NOT be a tail; it must has at least one next node
 * 
 * 	To do this simply we just copy the next node's value into our current node, to pretend the node is the "next" node, and delete the actual
 * 	next node by setting this node.next to node.next.next
