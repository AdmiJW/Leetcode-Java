/*
 * This is a HashMap problem.
 * 
 * Essentially, for each indices i, we will check to see if it is valid to convert all s[i] to t[i] without problem.
 * With this, we use a HashMap to record the mapping.
 * 
 * We know it is not valid when:
 * 	>	s[i] is already mapped, and mapped character is not t[i]
 * 	>	s[i] is not mapped, but t[i] is already mapped by another character
