/*
 * 	This is a Math problem.
 * 
 * 	The native algorithm already runs in O(log3 N) time, via iteration or recursion by simply repeatedly
 * 	dividing the original n, given that it is not negative to begin with
 * 
 * 	Some other methods are using logarithm to check if the power is actually an integer. If it is not, then
 * 	it is not valid power of three. However time complexity depends on the language implementation
 * 
 * 	Also, we could convert number into base 3, and check if it leads with a single '1' digit followed by all zeros.
 * 
 * 	Since by doing some math you know the number of solutions is relatively small, you can use HashSet for this job.
 * 
 * 	Lastly the most hardest solution, is that realize 3 is a prime number, and prime x prime is also prime.
 * 	Therefore, first you know the upper bound of problem is only until INT_MAX, which the highest power of 3 is 3^19.
 * 	Then, for a number N to be valid power of 3 which is prime, it must be able to divide 3^19. Check with modulo
