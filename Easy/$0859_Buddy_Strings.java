/*
 * 	A String problem.
 * 
 * 	We have to check if there is a single swap in String A which can end up totally equal to String B.
 * 	We split that into cases:
 * 		>	If A length is not equal to B length, immediately there is no possible swap.
 * 		>	If A is already total equal to B already, check if there is duplicate characters to swap
 * 		>	Otherwise, the number of differences need to be EXACTLY 2 (NO MORE NO LESS), and those 2 characters when 
 * 			swapped must match
