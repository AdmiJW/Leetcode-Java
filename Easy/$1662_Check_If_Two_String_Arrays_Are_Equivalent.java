/*
 * 	This is a String, which is an Array problem, since strings are essentially character arrays
 * 
 * 	The Brute force but workable way is to simply append all the strings. If the end result are equal then yes.
 * 	
 * 	--------------------------------
 * 
 * 	However the above solution is space consuming, since 
 * 		>	Strings are immutable. Each string is a instance of its own. Appending causes new instance to be created
 * 		>	We have to store 2 new strings, which is already exist in the parameter passed in
 * 
 * 	To check whether two strings are equal or not, we just have to ensure each character equals, and is of same length
 * 	We can use 2 pointers technique in this one
 * 	Since it is an array of strings, think of it as 2D jagged array. Index i points to a string, index j points to a
 * 	character in the string.
 * 
 * 	In this sense, we need 4 pointers. 2 pointing to strings in word1 and word2 respectively, another 2 pointing to
 * 	character in the string pointed by the prior two pointers.
 * 
 * 	Each iteration, check if the character pointers are out of range. If yes, proceed the string pointer and reset char
 * 	pointer to 0.
 * 
 * 	Also check for string pointer. If out of range, check if other one does as well.
 * 	>	If Yes, it means all the characters matched and we reach the end of both strings. Return true
 * 	>	Otherwise one string ended earlier while other has not. Return false.
 * 
 * 	Check if the characters pointed are equal. If not, immediately return false.
