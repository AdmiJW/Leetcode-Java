/*
 *	This question doesn't allow us to create a new array and return it. It requires us to manipulate the array on site. Therefore,
 *	it's easy to come up with a O(n^2) solution where everytime a 0 is met, shift all elements to the right of the 0 one step to the right,
 *	then duplicate the zero at the right of it.
 *
 *	Another solution of O(n) is to make two passes. From one pass we could find out how many zeroes would be discarded when the actual array
 *	is made, then in the second pass, we would copy the array from behind until front, to preserve the data that we haven't copied yet (and preserve
 *	O(1) space complexity). However with this method be careful that if the tail (the last scanned element) is zero and we don't have more spaces
 *	to put the zero inside, we simply copy the zero and skip scanning that zero element. (Edge case)
