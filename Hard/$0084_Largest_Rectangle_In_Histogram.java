/*
 * 	This is a Stack problem
 * 
 * 	One key intuition is that, every bar (x value) can be part of a rectangle, even if it is by itself (width = 1), it is
 * 	also a rectangle. Therefore the problem is whether the maximum rectangle starting with this bar is the global maximum
 * 	or not only.
 * 
 * 	--------------------------
 * 
 * 	Somehow the brute force solution works. For every x bar, it can be ending point for the rectangle that is formed behind
 * 	it.  (To the left)
 * 	For every x bar, we iterate again backwards to check the area of rectangle formed with width = 1, 2, 3... n.
 * 	This is time complexity of O(N^2) and it involves many repeated computation as the same rectangle is seen again
 * 	and again.
 * 
 * 	--------------------------
 * 
 * 	The intuition for O(N) solution is, every rectangle can also be the starting point of a rectangle. Just how far it
 * 	spans ahead, we don't know yet.
 * 
 * 	We will have a Stack which keeps track of "Started" rectangles behind of currently pointed bar.
 * 	For every bar, we first check:
 * 
 * 	>	If the bar is higher than previous started rects in the stack, it means that the previous started rect can extend
 * 		till the current bar, therefore we do nothing to them.
 * 		In addition, this current bar can start a rect, so we push the current index position and height to the Stack
 * 
 * 	>	If the bar however is lower than the previous started rect in the stack, it means this is the end of the previously
 * 		started rect. Pop it out, calculate the previous rect's area, update, and repeat the process until previous rect
 * 		is lower than current bar.
 * 		
 * 		Now we want to push the current bar into the Stack. But HOLD ON! Recall that the popped rects has height higher
 * 		than current one. Therefore this current rect shall had started before the current position! 
 * 
 * 		Thus, while popping the previous rects, we shall had keep track of the minimum starting position of them, and
 * 		use that as the starting position when we push current rect into the Stack.
