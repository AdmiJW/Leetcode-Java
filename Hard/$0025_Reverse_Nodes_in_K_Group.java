/*
 * This is a linked list problem.
 * 
 * First, recall to reverse a linked list normally, we need to have reference to three things:
 * 		>	Previous node
 * 		>	Current node
 * 		>	Next node
 * For each of the nodes, we simply
 * 		>	The current node's next pointer will point to previous node
 * 		>	Update previous node to be current node
 * 		>	Set current node to be next node
 * Repeat until you hit null pointer.
 * 
 * Now we have to reverse nodes in K groups. We can actually do what the problem asks: To apply the normal reverse linked
 * list algorithm in groups.
 * 
 * Given a linked list, we obtain the start and end node of each groups, while also having reference to the end node's next
 * node as well, so we don't get lost. (Also we should have the start node's previous node, or the end node of last reversed group)
 * Now, if we remove the end node's next pointer, then we can apply the normal reverse linked list algorithm already! Once
 * that's done, we simply connect everthing back to correct order.
