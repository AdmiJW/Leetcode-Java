/*
 * This is a Array greedy problem. HARD to get the idea with solution
 * 
 * When distributing candies, we always try to give as little candy as possible.
 * One such method is two pass.
 * First pass is from left to right, which we keep comparing the current child with the
 * previous one, and give extra candy whenever current child has higher rating than the previous
 * 
 * It is important to initialize the candies distributed to each children as 1, as the minimum candies each children can have
 * is 1.
 * 
 * After left to right, we also need to check each child relative to i+1 child. Using the previous candy distribution, put it as
 * max( candy[i], candy[i+1] + 1) whenever rating of ith child is greater than i+1 child.
 * This is because candy[i+1] + 1 might still be lower than candy[i] obtained from left to right iteration even after adding one
 * extra candy to it.
