 * 	This is a Monotonic Deque Sliding Window problem / Heap problem / Dynamic Programming Problem
 * 
 * 	The most common solution to come up with is by heap. We will push everything in the sliding window into the
 * 	heap, and as we slide the window, we remove the tail element and add the head element into the heap.
 * 
 * 	As we all know, heap allows us to retrieve the maximum element in O(1) time, however heapify process due to
 * 	insertion takes O(log N) time. And even worse in Java, heap's delete operation will take O(N) time as it iterates
 * 	the whole array to find the element for deletion.
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	A Monotonic deque is a data structure that:
 * 		>	Allows access to both ends element
 * 		>	Either non-increasing or non-decreasing / Increasing or Decreasing only
 * 	which is very useful in determining the max and min number, as seen in Kth maximum/ Kth minimum number problems.
 * 	It can be applied here too!
 * 
 * 	Basically when we try to push element, we push it at the back. And as long as the deque's end element is smaller, it means
 * 	that the smaller element is REDUNDANT (Meaning, if current updated element is already bigger, why bother the smaller ones?)
 * 	Therefore keep popping until finally it is bigger than current element, then push it in.
 * 
 * 	When we try to find the maximum element, just peek the queue's front element. It represents the largest element.
 * 
 * 	Then when we move the sliding window by 1 step, we check if queue's front element is the one that get popped. If it is,
 * 	then poll the front element, and proceed. The second element should be the 2nd largest element in sliding window now.
 * 
 * 	This algorithm is good as it takes O(N) time and O(k) space.
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The Dynamic Programming solution is ingenious. First, we have to generate an array where each grid stores the maximum value
 * 	from left to right. 
 * 
 * 			Eg: [3,1,4,5,3]  => [3,3,4,5,5] (Strictly increasing)
 * 
 * 	And the same with right to left.
 * 	However, the array need to be partitioned by the window size K. Once we hit the partition boundary, maximum is reset to minimum
 * 	and we start over. Assume K = 3, then
 * 
 * 			Eg: [3,5,2,2,1]		=>	[3,5,5 | 2,2]		See that it reset after every 3 elements.
 * 
 * 	Then in the end, in the result array, at index i (which the window covers i until i+k element), we just take the maximum
 * 	of the RtoL[i] and LtoR[i + k]
 * 
 * 	Since the maximum is most possibly at right side of the LtoR array, we take the head of the sliding window (i+k)
 * 	Since the maximum is most possibly at left side of the RtoL array, we take the tail of the sliding window (i)
 * 
 * 	The resetting is to ensure that the elements that are popped and possibly be the maximum element don't get counted into 
 * 	the evaluation. The rest of maximum element should be covered by the array of other direction
 * 
 * 			Eg: [3,1,2,0,4]
 * 
 * 			LtoR: [3,3,3 | 0, 4]
 * 			RtoL: [3,2,2 | 4, 4]
 * 
 * 			At i = 1 (Window [1,3]), The LtoR is taking index 3, which checks the maximum after the partition,
 * 									 while RtoL is taking index 1, which checks the maximum before partition, excluding the popped element
 *
