/*
 * 	The base idea of this whole question is split like this:
 * 		>	Copy all the intervals which doesn't intersect with the newInterval, which is located before (Less than) the newInterval
 * 			(Done by checking each interval's end with the newInterval's start. If the interval's end is less than newInterval's
 * 			 start, they don't intersect so add them to the result arr)
 * 		>	Merge those intervals which intersect with the newInterval into one single large interval.
 * 		>	Then, copy again all intervals which doesn't intersect with the newInterval, but is located after (More than) the
 * 			newInterval
 * 			(Done by checking each interval's start with the newInterval's end. If the interval's start is greater than newInterval's
 * 			 end, they don't intersect so add them to the result arr)
 * 
 * 	
 * 	A trick here is we can actually perform binary search here to skip over iterating through the intervals which intersect with
 * 	the newInterval. This proves effective if the interval set is large, and there are a lot of intervals intersecting.
 * 
 * 	The core idea of binary search is:
 * 		I will find the first interval (LEFT), which its start value is less than that of newInterval's start value, but its
 * 		next interval must has the start value greater or equal to target start. See:
 * 
 * 			___		|		______		|	    ___			|	___
 * 		___			|	______			|	___     ____	| __________ ___	
 * 		 ^				  ^					 ^					^
 * 
 *	 	This interval selected is the crucial one. It either means the newInterval must be inserted after the selected left interval
 *		(Case 1, 3), or merge the newInterval's start to be left interval's start (Case 2, 4)
 * 	
 * 		
 * 		Then I will find another first interval (RIGHT), which its end value is always greater than the newInterval's end,
 * 		but its previous interval must has its end value lesser or equal to the newInterval's end value
 * 
 * 		_________		|		______		|		_______		|		___
 * 		___ ________	| ____________ ___	|	__			__	| ______ ______
 * 				^						^					 ^				^
 * 
 * 		This interval selected is the crucial one. It either means the newInterval must be inserted before the selected right interval
 * 		(Case 2, 3), or merge the newInterval's end value to be right interval's end (Case 1, 4)
 * 
 * 
 * 		There are 2 edge cases we have to consider for:
 * 		>	All intervals are greater than the newInterval.
 * 			This means the left pointer and right pointer will all be index 0.
 * 			Then the toBeInserted interval start value must be kept as it is, and anything else will be dealt in the right Pointer
 * 			part
 * 		>	All intervals are lesser than the newInterval.
 * 			This means the left pointer and right pointer will all be index (len - 1)
 * 			Then the toBeInserted interval end value must be kept as it is, don't need to worry about the left Pointer part
