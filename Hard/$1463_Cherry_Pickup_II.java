/*
 * 	This is a HARD 3D tabulation Dynamic programming problem. I am unable to solve without looking at solution
 * 
 * 	The unique states of this problem are - At each row, the robots can be at 2 unqiue or same coordinates.
 * 	Therefore, to do DP, we need to have a 3D array
 * 		-	First index is the row that both robots are on
 * 		-	Second index is the column of the first robot
 * 		-	Third index is the column of the second robot
 * 
 * 	On each grid, it records the maximum cherry that can be picked by both the robots, from beginning until this
 * 	grid
 * 
 * 	** Note that from the topmost row to the bottom row is THE SAME AS from bottom row to topmost row. Since they are
 * 	symmetric, we prefer to do bottom up because although we sacrifice extra computations, it makes our mental health
 * 	better 
 * 
 * 	
 * 	At each grid, we know that the robot will pick the cherry at their individual positions
 * 			Cherry pick by robot1 at its pos + Cherry pick by robot2 at its pos
 * 
 * 	Except if both robots are at same position, the cherry cannot be double counted so minus it
 * 
 * 	Then, here is where DP comes in. Since from bottom,
 * 
 * 		>	Say robot is at j. It could come from the below row, j-1, j, or j+1
 * 		>	Say robot is at k. It could come from the below row, k-1, k, or k+1
 * 
 * 	Now, 3 x 3 means 9 grids we have to check for. 
 * 
 * 	Eventually up until the top row, we have our answer at dp[0][0][col-1], meaning
 * 	the maximum cherry picked by robots at row 0, robot1 at 0 and robot2 at col-1
 * 
 * 	------------------------
 * 
 * 	Similarly if we don't want to do bottom up DP by tabulation, we can use recursion with memoization
 *
