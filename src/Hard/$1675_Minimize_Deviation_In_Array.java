/*
 * 	YES, this is a HARD Heap/ TreeSet problem.
 * 
 * 	PS: Although I misread the question and thought that the differences must calculated in adjacent elements,
 * 	which makes a hard question even harder and can't figure it out
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Obviously, the maximum difference is always the MAX and MIN element in the array at a particular time. Also,
 * 	we can perform:
 * 	
 * 		>	Odd numbers can x2. 
 * 			Note that after x2, it becomes EVEN. So this operation can only be done once. Realizing this is the HARD part
 * 		>	Even numbers can /2. 
 * 
 * 	What if we can reduce the problem to be simpler? If we multiply all odd numbers by 2, the problem will essentialy
 * 	be reduced to find maximum diff in array of EVEN numbers only!
 * 
 * 	The idea is as follows: We will have a Heap-like data structure which allows us to retrieve max and min element
 * 	very fast. Pop the maximum element out. Calculate the difference with min element. Now, if it is even, we can reduce
 * 	it further by /2, and returning it to array. Keep doing it until you encounter that max element is odd number.
 * 	This is because we cannot further reduce odd number down by /2! It's against the rules.
