/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming, Tree Depth First Search (Postorder Traversal), Greedy Problem
 * 
 * 	I couldn't do it without looking at solution
 * 
 * 	By observation, you'll see that instead of placing a camera at leaf nodes, placing at their parent is more optimal.
 * 	Therefore, using this idea, we can have a HashSet of observed nodes, and perform postorder traversal and adding
 * 	cameras along the way. 
 * 	We perform postorder traversal because of the order where root is explored only after its children had been explored.
 * 
 * 	The criteria to put camera are:
 * 		>	Parent is null, and the node itself is not yet observed
 * 		>	Any of children is not observed
 * 
 * 	----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The DP approach is a bit more advanced (and for me, hard to figure), but for those who are familiar, seems straightforward
 * 	
 * 	First, realize that a node can be strictly in 3 states only:
 * 
 * 		1	Camera is installed at this node
 * 		2	No camera is installed, but is monitored by its children
 * 		3	Not monitored.
 * 
 * 	To achieve above states, those properties must be satisfy by its children. Since DP asserts the node's children MUST
 *  be monitored:
 * 
 * 		1	Since camera is installed at this node, children can be either 1,2,3 (NO restriction)
 * 		2	Either left child or right child has camera installed (1). The other can be (1) or (2)
 * 		3	To be not monitored, children must strictly be in state (2), because presence of camera in children
 * 			means parent will be monitored too.
 * 
 * 	For each node, query its children and get an array of size 3 representing the minumum camera needed to achieve that state.
