/*
 * 	This is a pure array problem.
 * 	We are required to find the first positive numbers missing in the array.
 * 	Meaning, if 1 is not present, ans is 1. Else, if 2 is not present, ans is 2. Else, if 3 is not present, ans is 3 etc...
 * 	The array is unsorted, how can we do this in O(N) time (few passes) and O(1) space? (Few variables)
 * 
 * 	
 * 	We would exploit the natural property of arrays - Their indexing. Although the array is indexed from 0 to N, we can think of them
 * 	as representing 1 to N+1.
 * 	(Now I will use 1 based indexing for arrays, NO 0 based indexing)
 * 	The index 1 shall store the value of 1 itself. The index 2 shall store the value of 2 itself. Basically, what the index is, the value
 * 	stored in it shall be the same.
 * 	Imagine if we have this array, where element at index I are value I itself, except ONE which is missing. If we iterate from beginning
 * 	of array (From 1 to N), once we detect the missing number, then it is the missing first positive number alright!
 * 	
 * 	How would we transform the array into the said form? We will keep a pointer to a position in the array, starting from the beginning.
 * 	Do this:
 * 
 * 		>	If the value is negative, zero, larger than the size of the array, or already in the suitable place (INDEX = VALUE)
 * 				Ignore this value. Increment the pointer
 * 
 * 		>	Otherwise, the value must have its respective place in the array. In other words, the value is a valid index of the array.
 *			Therefore, we will put this element into the suitable place, which is the index the value is pointing to.
 *			How about the element at the original place? We will swap it into the current pointer place then. Therefore, keep the pointer.
 *			Don't move the pointer
 *
 *			Consider the case of duplicates. [1, 1]. The pointer at 0 will keep attempting to swap 1 with value 1 at index 1. This causes
 *			infinite loop. Therefore, check beforehand the value at the index we are about to swap first. If it is already suitable value,
 *			don't care about it and continue on.
