/*
 *  This is a Graph Traversal - BFS problem.
 *  
 *  We want to find the shortest distance from the starting node to the end node, with the steps of either:
 *  		>	Go to next node
 *  		>	Go to previous node
 *  		>	Go to node with same value
 *  
 *  Therefore we need to Record all the nodes with the same value, by the index in the array. We can use a HashMap
 *  for this
 *  
 *  We can choose to record the shortest distance needed to reach a particular node, using a HashMap as well.
 *  
 *  On each Node, we have to record the distances to
 *  	-	Nodes of same values
 *  	-	Next node and Previous node
 *  
 *  Whenever we detected we had reached the end node, immediately return the distance to it.
 *  
 *  -----------------------
 *  
 *  However, consider case 1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,77,7,7,7...2. There are many 7 in between. In the worst case, we might
 *  have to go through all the 7's!. On each node 7, we have to go through all the indices of nodes with value 7, causing
 *  O(N^2) time! We must need to optimize it!
 *  
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  
 *  One little optimization is, through observation, we see that actually for a series of nodes with same value, like
 *  7,7,7,7, only the first one and last one is important! Therefore, we might just ignore the intemeidate nodes when
 *  constructing the graph. This solves the earlier problem where the nodes are bunched together, but now consider
 *  another case:
 *  
 *  		1,2,7,2,7,2,7,2,7... 3
 *  
 *  Since they are seperated, solution above won't work! Is there a better way?
 *  
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  
 *  The key is, since we are using BFS, when we had traversed to a node for first time, we must be having the shortest
 *  distance so far. Therefore, The other nodes having the same value, we will just write to them ONCE, that is during
 *  we first explored the node of this value. After that, we immediately delete the record of nodes with same value.
 *  Therefore the subsequent times we met the node, we won't be checking each one again, causing O(N^2) time!
 *  
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  
 *  Can we optimize space? Instead of using HashMap which records which node has which shortest distance from origin,
 *  remember thta we are using BFS, which we know the distance is just the 'layer' of BFS! Just keep a variable that
 *  keep tracks of the layers we have been through, and that is our distance!
