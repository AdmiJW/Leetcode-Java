/*
 * 	This is a Graph and BFS problem. 
 * 
 * 	What we want to determine is the shortest path from the beginWord, passing through intermediate strings, up until
 * 	the endWord (if any)
 * 
 * 	We can model this as a graph. The beginWord is actually a node by itself and we are going to start traversal from
 * 	it. 
 * 	Then, what nodes are actually 'neighbors' of it? The neighboring nodes are actually the possible strings that can
 * 	be formed by changing one character of the string.
 * 	Of course, we are not going to include each of the possible transformed strings into the actual graph. We'll only
 * 	put what's useful - The words that are actually in the wordList to be neighboring nodes.
 * 
 * 	Now we have set up the path which potentially link beginWord to endWord. The traversal algorithm to use is Breadth
 * 	First Search, as it is always searching layer by layer, and guarantees that once endWord is found, we are at the
 * 	shortest level.
 * 
 * 	Lets see time complexity:
 * 		Worst case we'll traverse through all the words in wordList. O(N) for this
 * 		Then, for each word, we need to generate all transformations. O(L) where L is the length of the string
 * 		Each character we need to attempt all possible characters (26 for lowercase alphabets). Consider O(C) or O(1)
 * 		Say each characters result in a valid transformation. Then we need to make a copy of the string for each of them.
 * 		O(L) for that then
 * 
 *	Thus time complexity is O(L^2 * N) 
 *	Space complexity - We use a Set and Queue to store the words. They are O(NL) in size.  
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	A BFS is quite good. However, as the BFS gets deeper and the nodes keep increasing, the 'radius' of the search area
 * 	keeps increasing exponentially (Consider a Binary Tree - Each layer has 2^L nodes)
 * 
 * 	We could potentially minimize the radius by applying bidirectional Breadth First Search. The BST will be conducted on
 * 	both sides. Each iteration the one with minimum level nodes will be selected to explore.
 * 
 * 	Hopefully, the exploration will intersect at the middle, where the BST of one side meets the nodes explored by the
 * 	other sides. This immmediately shows that there is a valid path from One side to another side, which is also at the
 * 	time, minimum distance.
 * 
 * 	At worst case, There is no path from one side to another. This one will result in worst case All the nodes be explored,
 * 	which isn't too bad as well as in normal BST
 * 
 * 	Time and space complexity is same. It is purely a optimization method.
