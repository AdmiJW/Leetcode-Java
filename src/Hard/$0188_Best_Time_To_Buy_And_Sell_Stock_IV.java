/*
 * 	This is a typical Dynamic Programming Question
 * 
 * 	Given maximum k transaction actions that we could perform, find out the maximum profit given stock prices.
 * 
 * 	For dynamic programming, we have to think in terms of how the solution to the subproblem can help me solve the larger
 * 	problem.
 * 	In this problem, the subproblems are: Given lower k, what is the maximum profit up to each day?
 * 
 * 	The most base problem is that k=1, find out the maximum profit from day 1, day 2, day 3 until day N.
 * 	Meaning, the DP array shall store in the columns, the maximum profit that I can reap in the range from day 0 until
 * 	the latest day up to day N.
 * 	
 * 	Now, if we know the solution to K=1 the maximum profit of each day spans, what we could do is to try and insert another
 * 	transaction into the transactions, so that number of transactions increase by 1!
 * 	
 * 	The basic algorithm looks like this:
 * 
 * 		For each transaction limits from 0 to N:
 * 			For each day:
 * 				Find out the maximum profit that I can reap with this transaction limit, from day 0 until this day.
 * 
 * 	How would we find out the maximum profit? We can try to loop through the previous days, and find the maximum such that
 * 
 * 				PROFIT FROM THIS TRADE						INHERIT THE PREVIOUS DAY'S MAX PROFIT
 * 		( price of current day - price of prev day ) + ( prev day's prev day Maximum Profit (DP)  )
 * 	is the largest.
 * 
 * 	The DP array would be a 2D array where rows are transaction counts from 0 to K, and columns are day 0 to N.
 * 	This would end up in time complexity of O(N^2 * K ), in addition to looping through the 2D array, each day we have to
 * 	iterate backward to see the maximum profit if I decided to sell on this day.
 * 
 * 	Let's say the day = 4. See those iterations:
 * 			price[4] - price[3] + dp[2]
 * 			price[4] - price[2] + dp[1]
 * 			price[4] - price[1] + dp[0]
 * 	Notice that for the maximum price to form, the dp[] - price[] part must be maximum! Therefore, we can remove the
 * 	necessity to iterate backwards by only keeping track of the maximum difference!
