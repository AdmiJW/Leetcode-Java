/*
 * This question is highly related to the merging process in Merge Sort algorithm.
 * Do check it out if haven't
 * 
 * The core intuition is very similar to how we merge 2 linked lists in Merge Sort.
 * However this time we have K sorted lists instead of just 2! How?
 * 
 * One brute forcey way is:
 * 		While there is still lists that aren't finish yet, iterate through all the HEAD of
 * 		K lists. Find out the minimum one, to append to the new linked list.
 * 
 * 	The time complexity is approximately O(NK) because:
 * 		while there are elements still left, an iteration of K times will run to find minimum node.
 * 		There are total of N elements.
 * 
 *	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	The expensive part of above algorithm is the iteration of K times. Can we search out the minimum
 *	node in shorter time complexity? O(Log N)? - Heaps!
 *
 *	Push every Head of the sorted linked list into the Heap. It will sort out automatically for us.
 *	Then pop out the smallest one, append to tail of new linked list, then check:
 *	If the popped linked list has next node, push the next node into Heap.
 *
 *	Time complexity reduced to O(N log K), but space O(K) is traded off
