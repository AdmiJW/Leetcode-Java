/*
 * 	This is the same as N-Queens problem (Backtracking), except it only require us to give the number of solution
 * 	this time.
 * 
 * 	The same rule applies as in the problem N-Queens. I recommend you to refer that in Hard > N_Queens
 * 	Here I use 3 Hashsets to represent the occupied column, diagonal and antidiagonal for backtracking 
 * 
 *	Note that this code is slow for some reasons especially in C++. For top speed, you may prompt for bitwise solution to represent which
 *	cols, diagonals and antidiagonals had been visited.
