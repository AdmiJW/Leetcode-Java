 *  This turns out to be a Merge sort / BST problem. It is hard, so I have to look at solution XD
 * 	However, only merge sort solution is discussed here as it is guaranteed O(N log N) time.
 * 
 * 	Merge sort, uses divide and conquer strategy with recursion to sort an array. For given range in an array [l,r],
 * 	it splits the range into two to sort. Once returned, it will use two pointers to finally MERGE the two separate
 * 	sorted array into one.
 * 
 *  Notice here, during splitting, original order of the array is not yet lost:
 *  		[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
 *  	[1,2,3,4]   [5,6,7]
 *   [1,2] [3,4]	[5,6]  [7]
 *  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
 *  
 *  In all the levels, the right subarray elements must be to the right of all left subarray elements in the original unsorted
 *  array. Does that ring a bell?
 *  
 *  Let's start from bottom. Once the subarray of size 1 (base case) is returned, we will combine two subarrays.
 *  Let's say left side is [5], and right size is [1]. 
 *  We'll notice that right side's [1] has to be go to the left of [5]! This means in original unsorted array, 5 comes before
 *  1, which means a smaller number after 5!
 *  
 *  Therefore, the idea is to count the number of elements in right subarray that has to go before elements in left subarray.
 *  When left element is selected, I have to account for how many right subarray elements had been choosen before this left
 *  subarray element is chosen (How many smaller numbers are to the right of the element).
 *  
 *  This means I have to track the original indices of each element as well, because I need to update the result array as well.
 *  This can be done by having a pair of {val, idx}
