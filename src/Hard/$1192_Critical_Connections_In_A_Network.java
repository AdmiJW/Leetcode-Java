/*
 * 	This is a Graph - Bridge Finding Problem. The core algorithm required is Tarjan's SCC Algorithm.
 * 	SCC stands for Strongly Connected Components.
 * 
 * 	First, construct the graph as it is. Now, since the nodes are all assured to be connected, we can
 *  randomly select one node and go perform dfs in it.
 *  
 *  Now, we would want to record the 'time' of each recursion call. Time essentially will increment by 1
 *  in each layer of recursion, and no node shall have same time value. So, first node to do dfs will have
 * 	time of 0 (or 1), then 1, 2... and so on.
 * 
 * 	The idea is, first realize that critical connections are essentially bridges in graph terms. It is the edge
 * 	that connect two separate, independent CYCLES.
 * 	In other words, if an edge is present/ participated in forming a cycle in graph, then it will not be
 * 	crucial connection.
 * 
 *  So how do we find out such cycle? The idea is, when dfs, we mark each node by the 'time' mentioned earlier
 *  in incrementing manner.
 *  If suddenly in dfs, we hit a node where 'time' value is less than parent node, then we know, the node is
 *  visited earlier and a cycle is present!
 *  
 *  Now the node knows that it forms a cycle and thus the edge cannot be crucial connection. How can it inform
 *	the upper recursion calls that this path couldn't be a crucial connection?
 *	
 *	Here goes the idea of low-link values. Each node, apart from 'time' value, also need to have low-link values.
 *	Low-link value of a node, is the lowest 'time' available of node in reach, if I started traversal from that node.
 *	If node A of time 8, is able to reach node B of time '1', then the low-link value of A is 1.
 *
 *	Therefore the recursion call will return the low-link value obtained from the node. Thus passing back to upper calls,
 *	the ancestors will get to know if they traversed the child node, what low-link value can it possibly reach.
 *	The low-link values of each node shall be initialized to their 'time 'value
 *
 *	Thus, if on the parent node during recursing child nodes, if they get the return value (low-link value of child) is
 *	lesser or equal to its own 'time' value, then it means a cycle is formed! The edge from current node to that child
 *	cannot be crucial connection.
 *	Reversing the logic, if the return value is greater than parent itself (Should be time+1), then no cycle is formed
 *	from parent to child, so IT IS crucial connection
