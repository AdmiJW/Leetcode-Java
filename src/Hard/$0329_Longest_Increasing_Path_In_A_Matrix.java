/*
 * 	This is a graph DFS traversal with Dynamic Programming - Memoization problem.
 * 
 * 	Every grid in the matrix is a node in graph. The node is connected to another node if the other node has value strictly
 * 	greater than current node. 
 * 	Due to the nature of going from lower value to higher value, the graph is directed graph, and there shall not exist any
 * 	cycle in the graph.
 * 
 * 	If we were to perform brute force, we iterate through each node. For each of the nodes, we simply perform dfs on it and
 * 	see how many maximum layer it can span.
 * 	At the end, simply return the maximum layer of one source node as answer. 
 * 	Say the matrix is NxN in size, then the time complexity will be about O(N^4), not efficient at all.
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Some of the nodes may have been visited before! Say i have matrix of 1 row: [5,4,3,2]. Now include the newest column
 * 	[5,4,3,2,1]. On node (1), I have to iterate through 5,4,3,2 once more, although it has been previously determined,
 * 	that (2) can span to level 4!
 * 
 * 	Therefore simply use a dp array to store the results of DP. 
 * 
 * 	Say we are exploring a node. If we found out its neighbour haven't been visited yet, we perform the very same DP on it,
 * 	so that DP value of neighbor will be defined and we are able to evaluate the value of neighbor.
 * 
 * 	Time is thereby reduced to O(N^2), as each node is never reexplored, all is stored in DP array
