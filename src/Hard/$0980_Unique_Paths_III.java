/*
* 	This is a backtracking, DFS problem
* 
* 	First, we have to obtain extra information from the grid itself. We need to know:
* 	>	How many non-obstacle grids are there, so we know when we have explored all non-obstacle grids
* 	>	The starting grid position, to know where to start the DFS backtracking
* 
* 	Then, for each grid in the recursion (or do it iteratively), we first need to define the base case:
* 		>	If it is the ending grid, add 1 to the result (Meaning one path discovered) only if all the non-obstacle grids are
* 			explored (Represented as a counter which decrements)
* 	Otherwise, mark the grid as explored (Changing the value in place), then explore all 4 directions, but based on some constraints
* 	>	Not explored grid
* 	>	Not out of bounds
* 	>	Not obstacle
* 
* 	After doing the exploration on 4 direction and obtained their results, revert the change to the grid itself. and return the value
