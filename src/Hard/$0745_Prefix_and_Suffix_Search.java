/*
 * 	This is a advanced Trie problem.
 * 
 * 	For searching of words, Trie might be a good solution especially if our dictionary consists a lot of repeating
 * 	prefixes and suffixes, since they will be sharing the same data.
 * 
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------
 * 	
 * 	If thinking about tries, we might have an idea of using 2 tries in this problem. One for prefix, and one for
 * 	suffix. Once we query, we obtain two set of possible indices for both prefix and suffix. 
 * 	Then, to get a set of VALID indices, intersect the two sets, and return the maximum of them.
 * 	
 * 	However, this solution results in time limit exceeded, due to the size of sets may be large
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Another suggested idea is to create a Pair Trie. Essentially, instead of travelling in the trie for one character
 * 	at a time, we query for prefix and suffix. Eg:
 * 		"Apple",
 * 	Then when creating trie, we put(a,e), then (p,l), then (p,p), then (l,p), then (e,a)
 * 	
 * 	This is good for equal length queries, like ("ap", "le"). However, we have to also consider vary length
 * 	queries, like ("app", "e")
 * 
 * 	For this, we need to increase complexity. For each possible prefixes, generate all wildcard suffixes. Like
 * 	prefix = "ap", we need to consider
 * 			("ap, "apple")
 * 			("ap, "#pple")
 * 			("ap, "##ple")
 * 			("ap, "###le")
 * 			("ap, "####e") where # means missing suffixes, a wildcard
 * 	The same goes for missing prefixes. In the end, creating the trie is not so easy after all!
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	A more easier to implement solution, is to put words in trie in <suffixes><sep><word> form.
 * 	Eg: "apple"
 * 			put "e{apple"
 * 				"le{apple"
 * 				"ple{apple"
 * 				"pple{apple"
 * 				"apple{apple"
 * 
 * 	When querying like ("app", "le"), we query the trie in form of <suffix><sep><prefix>, so in this case,
 * 	query "le{app"
 * 	As we can see, the example case 2 will get queries, (but not until finish).
 * 	Since at the end it is a valid node, we can easily retrieve the index!
 * 
 * 	As for index assigning, we always put the latest index, since the index is always increasing, it remains valid
 * 	if we overwrite the previous recorded index!
