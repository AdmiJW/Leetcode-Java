/*
 * 	I couldn't solve this problem. Well, at least I learned Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree
 * 
 * 	The idea is, for every element I want to insert, I would need 2 informations:
 * 		The number of elements that are strictly smaller than current value. 
 * 		The number of elements that are strictly greater than current value.
 * 
 * 	The naive approach would be to have a frequency array, where value->frequency. However, for querying ranges
 * 	from 0 up to n, will take O(N) time. If implement the approach will be O(N^2) which results in Time Limit Exceeded.
 * 
 * 	If we use Prefix sum array, querying is fast in O(1), but updating still is O(N)!
 * 
 * 	So, There is Fenwick Tree which allows for updating in O(log N) as well as querying.
 * 	Every element before inserting, query for number of elements strictly less than current value (n-1), and number
 * 	of elements strictly greater than current value (Current index - get(n) ).
 * 
 * 	Then, update the fenwick tree on the current value.
