/*
 * 	This is indeed quite hard to get intuition at, especially for a O(N log N) solution, to realize that this is a
 * 	Longest Increasing Subsequence in disguise problem
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Start by sorting the envelopes by width. This way the problem becomes solvable via straight loop thru the envelopes.
 * 	This is because at particular point in the envelopes array, I know that the previous must consist of smaller envelope, 
 * 	and in front is larger envelopes which I cannot wrap in current envelope
 * 
 * 	First of all, think of a DP solution. In the final maximum envelopes subsequence, one of the elements in envelopes array
 * 	must be the ending envelope. Thus, we iterate through the envelopes. In each iteration, the envelope will be the ending
 * 	envelope for the subsequence, and we'll find out what is the maximum length of prior subsequences that can be prepended
 * 	to this ending envelope, thus we use DP here
 * 
 * 	Have a DP array of same size as envelopes (Except is just a 1D array). The element at index i represents if the envelope[i]
 * 	has to be ending envelope, what is the maximum length of subsequence that it can form. This is computed via having a
 * 	nested second loop which loop backwards to check each previous DP cases and whether the ending envelope for that one
 * 	is smaller than current ending envelope 
 * 
 * 	Therefore with this algorithm, the time complexity is O(N^2) while space used is O(N). 
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Think again about the sorted properties: In front of current point is larger envelopes, and previous ones are smaller.
 * 	Therefore, the problem for width of envelope is solved. Now, I actually just have to find out the longest increasing
 * 	height subsequence in the sorted envelopes! In other words, it is a longest increasing subsequence problem of heights!
 * 
 * 	However, there is one problem: Consider [1,1], [1,2], [1,3]. 
 * 	If I follow suit the original sorting algorithm and apply LIS algorithm on this, the longest subsequence found will be
 * 	(1,2,3), although the width is the same and can't be counted! How to remedy this?
 * 
 * 	If you smart, then you know to sort the heights by descending order, like so:
 * 		[1,3], [1,2], [1,1]
 * 	Then the longest subsequence algorithm won't be able to span anymore, and that's the behavior we want!
 * 
 * 	
 * 	For more info on the Longest Increasing Subsequence algorithm in O(N log N) time, visit the Topics > Dynamic_Programming
 * 	> Longest_Non_Decreasing_Subsequence.
 * 
 * 	Time is reduced to O(N log N) time, with same space complexity of O(N)
