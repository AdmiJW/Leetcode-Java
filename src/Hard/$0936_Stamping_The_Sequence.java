/*
 * 	This is a Greedy, String iteration problem.
 * 
 * 	Think of chopping stamps. Say If I have 'abcdef' and I chop 'zzz' starting at index 1, then string becomes
 * 	'azzzef'.
 * 	Notice how zzz essentially replaces 'bcd', we can think of it as a layer of 'zzz' being stacked on top of it!
 * 	Now, target is formed by stamping multiple times, thus, it is like a stack of stamping layers!
 * 
 * 	Therefore, the intuition is that, we can simply 'unstack' the layers. In other words, if we can reverse the target
 * 	back into "??????", then our job is done!
 * 
 * 	The algorithm then becomes:
 * 		While there is still stamping layer, aka not all characters are unstamped, we shall iterate:
 * 			Check all substrings of same size as stamp. Check if they can be unstamped or not
 * 			If they can be unstamped, unstamp by replace the characters by wildcard like '*'
 * 			
 *	Note that unstamped characters are replaced by '*', so in future iterations, stamp 'abc' is able to match 'a**' or 'ab*'
 *	or '**c'. However, we shouldn't match '***' because the entire substring is already unstamped before!
