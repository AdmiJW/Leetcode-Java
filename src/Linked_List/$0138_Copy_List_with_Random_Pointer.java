/*
 * 	To copy a linked list with random pointers, a more intuitive way to solve it is to use mapping so that the node from original linked list points to the
 * 	duplicated node, which can be used in constructing the deep copy of the linked list
 * 
 * 	Starting to iterating from the head, we check in each iteration if the current node has a duplicate already due to previous node's random pointer. If no,
 * 	then create a duplicate and put it into the mapping as well. If yes, just extract it and assign it as the previous node's next.
 * 	Now take a look at original node's random pointer. Check again if the mapping already contains the duplicate node constructed. If no, create one and assign it
 * 	to duplicate node's random pointer, else, extract it and assign it.
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	To avoid using O(n) space (excluding the extra space due to copying) due to hash map, we could use Weaving technique, but it requires 3 iterations in total
 * 	-The first iteration is just duplicating the nodes and attaching it to the node's next
 * 	-The second iteration will involve only the duplicated nodes, assigning their random pointer to the original one random's next (Which is duplicated in last iteration)
 * 	-The third iteration will revert the changes by extracting the duplicated nodes, and undo the changes on the original linked list so that the original is back
 * 		to normal
