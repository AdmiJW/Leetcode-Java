/*
 * 	Linked list uses a lot of two pointers technique
 * 
 *	To do this in a single pass, the basic idea is to keep two pointers where the fast pointer is always n steps ahead of the slow pointer. Once we see that
 *	the fast pointer reached the end, we know that slow pointer is about n steps away from the end. Therefore we could perform the deletion of node at the slow pointer
 *	
 *	The edge cases is deletion of the first node, which when fast pointer is initialized, will point directly to null. Therefore fix is to directly return the
 *	head's next node.
