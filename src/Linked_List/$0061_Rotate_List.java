/*
 * 	This is a two-pointers question. We are asked to rotate the linked list k steps to the right. Notice that the k might be larger than the linked list size.
 * 	This is example of limited state space question where it will be a cycle if k is larger than the linked list, it will go back to the original state and loop again.
 * 	Dealing with this kind of limited state space question, we need to find the loop and use modulo to prevent unnecessary calculations.
 * 
 * 	The basic idea is to find out the length of the linked list. Then we have to modulo k by the length
 * 	Notice if k is now 0, then just return head. The rotation will end up at same place.
 * 	Then, move the pointer to the length - k'th node. This is the node which the rotated linked list ends. Save the next node in temp variable and put this node's next
 * 	as null.
 * 	Iterate to the end of the linked list and attach the head to end of linked list.
