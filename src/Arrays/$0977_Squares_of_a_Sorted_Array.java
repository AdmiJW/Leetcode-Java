/*
 * 	I attempted to use binary search to find for the first index of the element which is first to be positive (previous element is negative)
 * 		-All positive array > returns 0
 * 		-All negative array > returns last index
 * 		-Length 1 array 	> returns 0
 * 
 * 	With the index obtained, Notice the array is provided in ascending order, therefore for negative part of the array, going further to the
 * 	left will end up squaring bigger, and for positive part of the array, going further to the right will end up squaring bigger as well.
 * 
 * 	Therefore I make 2 pointers one pointing to the beginning of the positive part and one pointing to the "tail" of the negative part, and
 * 	each loop I'll determine which of these will give smaller squares and include it into the resulting array
 * 
 * 
 * 	** The nested conditional checking is quite messy. Instead I can loop only when both of the pointers are in range, then outside
 * 	   the loop, i add 2 loops to loop through the remaining elements.
