/*
 * 	It is easy if we are permitted extra memory for this. We could just do a HashSet, initialize it and remove the elements that we met in the
 * 	array.
 * 	
 * 	To do this in O(n) time and O(1) space (in-place), we have to think to transform the array itself into some sort of counter.
 * 	This exploits the fact that the value of the nums must be in range 1 to n where n is the size of array itself.
 * 	We can make the indexing of the array as the representation of the value itself. For example index 0 represents frequency of value 1,
 * 	index 1 represents frequency of value 2...
 * 	Since we only need to know which element was never met, we mark those who exists in the array with a negative integer, Eg: -1.
 * 	We keep a pointer to keep track of the progress. Every time we met an element which was not negative, we follow its path and mark the location
 * 	with a negative number. To not lose information, we store the value beforehand and then do the iteration again with the value overwritten,
 * 	until another negative number is met.
 * 
 * 
 * 	We can optimize the solution to not do the iteration part. We just mark the value to its negative counter part. In the first iteration
 * 	no matter it is negative or not we'll just consider it, go to its place, and change value to negative if it's positive beforehand
 *	
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION
 *	is to doing some kind of O(n) sort. For every value we met we'll swap it with it's respective place represented by index.
 *	Eg: For value 3 we'll swap it with element in index 2 (Since indexing starts with 0). (After swapping stay in place to check again)
 *	The constraints are:
 *		-If the value in that place is already of the same, don't swap them
 *		-If the current value is already in place, do nothing
 *	
 *	In the end, the values should be in their respective places already. The final iteration checks if the value matches the index. If not,
 *	this value does not exist
