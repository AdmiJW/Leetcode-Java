/*
 * 	My proposed solution is as follows:
 * 	
 * 	Let's think what each of the operation actually mean - Given each operation can be performed infinite times
 * 
 *	#1 - You are allowed to swap characters
 *		(This means the position of the characters doesn't matter. As long as the frequency of each unique character
 *		in both string matches, there must be a way to swap until match)
 *
 *	#2 - You can mass swap between two unique characters. Eg: aaaabb -> bbaaaa
 *		(This means the frequency of one unique character can be swapped with another frequency of another
 *		unique character!
 *		In example above, { a: 4, b: 2 } got swapped to { a: 2, b: 4 }
 *
 *	With both things in mind, we can construct some conditions:
 *
 *	>	If there is a non existent character that is in str2, but not in str1, its impossible!
 *	>	Since frequency of unique characters can swap, the frequency of frequency (YES) matters. Character now 
 *		doesn't matter
 *	>	if both strings has the same frequency of frequency pattern, then yes it can be said to be close string!
 *		Return true
