/*
 * 	This is a Binary Search | Two pointers greedy sliding window problem.
 * 
 * 	For Brute force approach, we would try summing up elements from left to right. On each element added,
 * 	start an iteration from the right to find out if there is also a sum which makes up to x.
 * 
 * 	Time complexity is O(N^2) with constant space. Can we do better?
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------
 * 
 * 	It is obvious we need extra information to solve the problem. Say, if we already have the prefix sum array
 * 	beforehand. 
 * 	Then it means now when we summing up the elements from right to left (More convenient), we
 * 	can retrieve the other side's sum using binary search.
 * 	
 * 	This way time complexity is reduced to O(N log N), but uses extra space O(N)
 * 
 * 	----------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The optimized solution comes with the idea of this:
 * 
 * 	First sum up every elements from left to right. Along the way if there is matching x, record it.
 * 
 * 	Then, We will start the iteration from right. While the left part's sum is greater than required value from the
 * 	right, start retracting the sum by moving back to the left. Repeat while the left sum is greater than the 
 * 	required value.
 * 
 * 	The idea is:	From right to left, value is always increasing (Since it is summing). 
 * 					That means value required by right will always be decreasing.
 * 					Therefore it is no problem to be retracing the left window.
