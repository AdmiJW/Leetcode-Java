//https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/

/*
 * 	This is a Array, Greedy, Pigeonhole principle problem.
 * 
 * 	We have to try to flip the dominos such at one of the rows have all the same values, regardless of another row.
 * 	From thinking, we can immediately deduce that since we saw the first domino, there can be at most 2 values that
 * 	satisfy the solution already - The upper value of domino 1, or lower value of domino 2.
 * 
 * 	Actually, we can brute force by attempting to form the upper row to be all same value (Not considering lower row),
 * 	from 1 to 6. If any of value is found not possible, immediately exit the loop and continue to next iteration.
 * 
 * 	We will keep a counter to keep track of how many flips we've done.
 * 	Because we are going to form the row at upper side, if the next domino's upper value is the one we're looking for,
 * 	continue without doing anything. Otherwise if the lower value only is the value we're looking, then increment the 
 * 	counter. Otherwise, the value is simply not possible.
 * 
 * 	What if the minimum number of flips are actually achieved by flipping to lower and not upper? Since there are only
 * 	2 possible flips: Upper and Lower, it can be found easily by using (len - flip).
 * 
 * 	However, using formula above will be incorrect because there are actually dominos that have same value on both upper
 * 	and lower! Then, we have to keep a duplicates counter to keep track of duplicates, then when we finding out the
 * 	complement, we use (len - flip - duplicates)!
 * 
 * 	----------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Alternatively, we can use 2 counters - Flipping to upper and flipping to lower. Then we don't have to keep a duplicate
 * 	counter, and the code may be cleaner
 * 
 * 	============================================================
 * 
 * 	PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE
 * 
 * 	When the value1 DOES end up successfully (There is a way to flip to all same in a row), then THERE IS NO POSSIBLE
 * 	WAY FOR VALUE2 TO FLIP TO SAME SIDE ALREADY, UNLESS FLIP1 SOLUTION END UP IN ANOTHER ROW ALSO SAME VALUES
 * 
 * 	This is because if there is a way to make upper row all same value1, then that means:
 * 		THE FREQUENCY OF VALUE1 MUST BE >= N
 *  Now, this leaves two choices for value2:
 *  	>	If frequency of value1 == N, then value2 has to be frequency == N as well for it to come up with a solution,
 *  		which is same if we done checking the value1
 *  	>	If frequency of value1 > N, then value2 frequnecy < N, not possible to form a solution!
