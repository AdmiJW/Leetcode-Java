/*
 * 	This is an Array problem.
 * 
 * 	The way we can solve it is by simulate the process as if we are filling it ourselves.
 * 	
 * 		First, we fill from top row, from left to right. Note that after done, the top row is done so we
 * 		will not touch it anymore.
 * 
 * 		Then, we fill in at rightmost column, from previous row + 1 to bottom. Note that after done, the rightmost
 * 		column is done so we will not touch it anymore
 * 
 * 		Then, we fill in at bottom row, from previous column until leftmost column. Note that after done, the bottom
 * 		row is done so we will not touch it anymore
 * 
 * 		Lastly, we fill in at leftmost column, from previous row - 1 until top (but not touching the first row which
 * 		is done!). Note that after done, the leftmost column is done so we will not touch it anymore. 
 * 
 * 	As we can see, we just have to keep 4 variables indicating the bounds of the 4 sides, and with 4 loops in a
 * 	larger loop where each iteration completes one cycle, we can get it done.
 * 
 * 	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	To prevent 4 loops in one large loop, we can use array and a direction variable to indicate the direction
 * 	we are travelling. As soon as we hit the edges or the next grid to fill is not 0 (Previously filled), then
 * 	we will change direction.
