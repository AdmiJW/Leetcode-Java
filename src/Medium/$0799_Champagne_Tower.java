/*
 * 	This is a array simulation problem.
 * 
 * 	We have to ignore the fact that every glass has a fixed capacity which it can contain at most 1 cup capacity.
 * 	For every row, we can look at the previous rows result. Lets see an example:
 * 
 * 	Say initially we pour down 5 cup worth of champagne. In the first row, the champagne volume contained in the glass
 *  is 5, we will be ignoring the fact that the glass can contain only 1 cup worth of champagne
 *  Onto row 2, the first glass will depend on the last row (First row's) volume of champagne. We will be taking with formula:
 *  	(Volume of last glass champagne - 1) / 2
 *  We minus by 1 because the last row's glass may contain the 1 glass worth of champagne, if it is overflowed.
 *  We divide by 2 because the overflowed champagne flows equally to the left and right.
 *  Of course, if the last glass actually don't overflow, then the calculated value will be negative. Careful of that
 *  
 *  Now, the result will be like this:
 *  ( 5 )
 *  ( 2 )( 2 )		<-  (5 - 1) / 2
 *  (   )(   )(   )
 *  
 *  Let's compute row 3 now. Now there is 1 cup that will be dependent on 2 cups instead of one. How do we represent that?
 *  THe middle glass actually depends on half on the glass 0 and glass 1 on row 2. That means for every glass, the volume
 *  that flows into it is dependant on:
 *  	Last row glass N and Last row glass N-1
 *  
 * 	If we were to iterate backwards, we can reduce the space complexity to just O(N) without losing information!
