/*
 * 	This is a HashMap / Two pointers Sorting Problem
 * 
 * 	Each number n, we will raise a question. Is there a existing number i in the array such that
 * 			n + i = k
 * 
 * 	Therefore, we can set up a HashTable like a "Wanted Number Counter" which keeps track of the searched
 * 	number by previously visited numbers. 
 * 
 * 	So, each number,
 * 		if the number is being searched by HashTable, res += 1. And remove the search frequency of the number
 * 		by 1
 * 
 * 		Else, we want to search for k-n. Update in HashTable
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	We can also solve it in sorted array.
 * 	
 * 	Start two pointers from both ends of array. It shall be pointing at max and min element of array.
 * 	
 * 	Now, add the two elements pointed up. Say x+y. Check:
 * 		if x+y == k, we found a pair. Update in result variable, and move both pointers
 * 		if x+y < k, the smallest element is too small even if paired with large element. Move left pointer
 * 		if x+y > k, the largest element is too large even if paired with smallest element. Move right pointer
