/*
 * 	This problem is a dynamic programming question.
 * 	The key to realize first is that ugly numbers must be an ugly number multiplied by 2,3 or 5. See example:
 * 	1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12...
 * 	2 is 1 (Ugly) multiply 2
 * 	3 is 1 (Ugly) multiply 3
 * 	4 is 2 (Ugly) multiply 2
 * 	5 is 1 (Ugly) multiply 5
 * 	6 is 2 (Ugly) multiply 3 or 3 (Ugly) multiply 2
 * 	8 is 4 (Ugly) multiply 2
 * 	9 is 3 (Ugly) multiply 3
 * 	10 is 5(Ugly) multiply 2 or 2 (Ugly) multiply 5
 * 	12 is 6(Ugly) multiply 2 or 4 (Ugly) multiply 3
 * 
 * 	Notice 7 does not have any ugly number multiplied to 2,3,5, nor does 11.
 * 	14 is multiple of 2, but since it is 7 (NOT UGLY) times 2, it does not count as an ugly number
 * 
 * 	Therefore, instead of going through each possible ugly number to identify if it is an ugly number, try to generate ugly numbers instead, as most of the possible
 * 	numbers are not ugly, brute force solution would almost iterate until Integer.MAX times!
 * 
 * 	Make an array of n sizes where n is the argument to find nth ugly number, and initialize the array[0] to 1
 * 
 * 	Make three variables representing the multiples of 2, 3 and 5. Initialize them to 2,3 and 5 respectively. This means that they store the values of
 * 	1 (AN UGLY NUMBER) multiplied to 2, 3 and 5.
 * 
 * 	Make three pointers (just int variable) representing the indexes of where the ugly number multiplied come from. Initialize them to index 0, since
 * 	initially, the three multiplies of 2 3 and 5 are 2, 3 and 5 themselves, which came from the ugly number 1, at index 0 of ugly numbers
 * 
 * 	Now we have to iterate n times to fill the array. The array will get filled with ugly numbers, where each loop, we will determine the ugly number to be
 * 	chosen by using Math.min() on the three variables.
 * 	After filling in the ugly number, we have to update the variables. Check if the filled ugly number is of the same with each of the variables.
 * 	If yes, that means the ugly number is already been filled in, so we need to find the next ugly number and multiply by 2,3 or 5 respectively, depending on which
 * 	ugly number is filled.
 * 	Therefore, increment the index value by 1 (Meaning pointer has moved to next ugly number), and update the variable to have the next ugly number multiplied by
 * 	2, 3 or 5.
