/*
 * 	This is a graph, DFS / BFS problem.
 * 
 *  To clone a undirected graph, the hardest part is to establish the undirected connection. How are we going to know:
 *  >	If a node had been created before?
 *  >	If the connection already been established?
 *  
 *  We could make a Hashmap, that maps from the original node to the cloned node itself, it can be node's value, or the
 *  node by itself as the key.
 *  Now, For the DFS approach, we need to treat problems seperately, meaning we have to focus on the current node only.
 *  In the final node, the connections must be well established, all the node references must be already there in the 
 *  neighbors arraylist. 
 *  To achieve this, when we are iterating over the list of neighbors, try to call a DFS function on that neighbor node,
 *  so that it will return a node for us to establish a connection.
 *  What if later the connections are duplicated?
 *  By establishing the connection one way (From current node to the neighbor node, and not the other way around), we
 *  can ensure that no duplicate connection may occur, since in DFS it is already been established)
 *  
 *  Therefore the DFS must look like this.
 *  If the node already exists, return directly the node, so the parent recursive call can establish connection onto this
 *  node.
 *  Otherwise, create a new node, iterate over all neighbors and call dfs on them, and return this node.
