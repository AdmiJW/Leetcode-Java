//https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-matrix-diagonally/
/*
 * 	This is simply a simulation problem.
 * 
 * 	Traverse through the diagonals, pushing the elements into one single place where sorting algorithm can
 * 	be executed.
 * 	Then, put the sorted elements back to original matrix, or in a new matrix
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	If we don't want to do it diagonal one by one, we can use a HashMap of PriorityQueues
 * 
 * 	Remember this property:
 * 		The row index minus column index, i - j for each grid, gives a unique indexing for diagonals.
 * 
 * 	Like so:
 * 
 * 		0	-1	-2	-3
 * 		1	0	-1	-2
 * 		2	1	0	-1
 * 		3	2	1	0
