/*
 * 	This is a Tree, Depth first search problem (With possible mix of bit manipulation)
 * 
 * 	My idea is that, first we have to realize how a possible palindrome is made:
 * 	
 * 	Since a palindrome is split into two equal parts (with possibly one extra character in middle), where frequency of one
 *  character in left side must equal to its frequency in right side, Therefore each character must be of even frequency,
 *  with exception we can contain AT MOST one character with odd frequency, where the character is put at exact middle
 *  
 *  --------------------------------
 *  
 *  Therefore, while traversing the tree using DFS, the frequency of the node's value has to be increased, so it switches
 *  from being odd to even and vice versa. We record that into the boolean array.
 *  
 *  Then, if this node is a leaf node, check if the path from root node until current leaf node can form a valid
 *  palindrome or not.
 *  
 *  Recurse on the left and right subtree. The returned value has to be added to the result
 *  
 *  Then we revert the record of this current node, similar to backtracking. Then we can safely return to upper level
 *  
 *  --------------------------------
 *  
 *  Instead of using a boolean array, notice that we only need to use 9 bits to represent odd or even. Therefore,
 *  we can use bit manipulation instead of boolean array here.
