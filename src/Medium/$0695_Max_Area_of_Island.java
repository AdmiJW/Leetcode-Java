/*
 * 	This is a classical DFS problem (Flood fill).
 * 
 * 	Iterate through each grid. If the grid is a land, perform DFS on it which check for
 * 	neighbors if it is land, but before doing that, ensure that the originating land is marked
 * 	as visited so we don't end up in infinite recursion loop.
 * 	
 * 	This can be modelled as a graph, where each node is connecting to its adjacent 4 sides in
 * 	the grid.
