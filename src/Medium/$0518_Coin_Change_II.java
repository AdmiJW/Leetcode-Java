/*
 * 	A dynamic programming problem. In the dp table,
 * 		- Across horizontal column represents the goal of coin value we're reaching for, from 0 to n
 * 		- Across vertical row represents the coins we will be including, from { } to the set including all coins
 * 		- Each table cell represents the number of ways to form to the goal coin value from the current set of coins
 * 
 * 	To determine the value to put in each cell, we consider the following:
 * 		The ways to form to the goal value, is to not include the last coin, or to include the last coin.
 * 		-	Not including the last coin, it's essentially just the same number of ways to form the same goal without the last coin (value above)
 * 		-	Including the last coin, it's essentially asking number of ways to form the goal of (goal - coin value) using the same set of coins
 * 			(Same row, but (goal - coin value) column
 * 	
 * 		Since we think of both, we have to plus them together.
 * 
 * 	The initialization step is that, given an empty set of coins, the ways to form the goal is always 0, except if the goal itself is 0, then
 * 	it is 1
 * 	For the goal value itself is 0, the ways to form it is always 1
