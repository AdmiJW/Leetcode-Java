/*
 * 	This is a Breadth First Search problem, since BFS is good for searching shortest distance (Apart from more
 * 	complex algorithms like A* algorithm)
 * 
 * 	Use a Queue data structure to perform BFS. The level of the bfs is important to know the distance of the bfs.
 *	Start from the left upper corner, begin breadth first search algorithm. For each grid, explore it's eight sides.
 *	If the adjacent neighbor is not occupied (0), then add that to the exploration queue.
 *	Also, we have to mark that the grid is pending to be explored, so that it don't get added to the queue twice.
 *	We can do this in place, by marking the grid to 1, or use extra space to enforce immutability.
 *
 *	Time complexity is O(N^2) if square matrix, and space is O(max(N,M) ), either edge is longer will take that much
 *	space in the queue. (Except if use visited set instead of in-place)
