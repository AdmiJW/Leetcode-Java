/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming problem, which we can determine the main problem itself based on the answer to the subproblem
 * 	itself
 * 
 * 	We will create a DP array based on the maximum number of days provided, which is the last element in the days array
 * 	The DP array will store the answer to the question:
 * 		What is the minimum cost to buy the tickets, such that from day 1 until this day there is always valid train to sit
 * 
 * 	Every day, We make choices based on	the condition: is there a train ticket that I must be using on this day?
 * 	
 * 	If on this day, we have no train to sit, then we will just take the previous day's minimum cost
 * 	If on this day however, we have to sit a train, we have 3 choices:
 * 
 * 		>	Either we will buy a 1 day ticket on this day, therefore the cost will be previous day's minimum added
 * 			with the 1 day ticket price
 * 		>	This day, we will have a 7 day ticket which expires on this very day. We have purchased the 7 day ticket
 * 			right at 6 days ago. The cost will be previous 7 day's minimum added with the 7 day ticket price
 * 		>	This day, we will have a 30 day ticket which expires on this very day. We have purchased the 30 day ticket
 * 			right at 29 days ago. The cost will be previous 30 day's minimum added with the 30 day ticket price
 * 
 * 	We take the minimum of the three and put it as the answer to this day's dp
 * 
 * 
 * 		Time Complexity is O(N) - We just iterate through the days
 * 		Space Complexity is O(N) - We keep a DP array to keep track of the previous day's minimum
 *
