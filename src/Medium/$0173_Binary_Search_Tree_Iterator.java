/*
 * 	This is a Binary Search Tree Inorder Traversal Problem, with possible solution using Stack DS
 * 
 * 	
 * 	The most 'brute force' way yet easiest one is to immediately flatten the BST once the iterator is constructed.
 * 	FLatten can be done by simple recursion of inorder traversal (left - root - right) and storing it in a
 * 	possibly FIFO DS like Queue
 * 	This way of implementation ensures O(1) retrieval and checking, but the initialization does take O(N) and also
 * 	O(N) space as long as lifecycle of iterator haven't finish.
 * 
 * 	----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	A solution worth mentioned is to traverse the BST each time it is queried. Keeping the last node as record,
 * 	we can find the next least larger node in O(log N) time, assuming BST is balanced
 * 
 * 	This requires 2 pointers. One pointing to current node to explore, and the one pointing to the one previously
 * 	explored node.
 * 		When the current node is larger than the last recorded / returned node,
 * 			>	We have to search left side for possible smaller node but larger than last recorded.
 * 			>	So, record in prev, set currrent to left subtree.
 * 		When the current node is smaller than or equal to last recorded / returned node,
 * 			>	This node is IMPOSSIBLE to be returned since it is smaller.
 * 			>	However, we still need to search right subtree for possible solution
 * 
 * 	At the end, the current pointer will be null and previous is the solution.
 * 	If the node doesn't exist, the current pointer, which is initialized to last recorded, should remain same,
 * 	and from that information we know there is no more next node.
 * 
 * 	It can be optimized to automatically search for next node during retrieval function, so the checking function
 * 	can be done in O(1) time
 * 
 * 	Approach is O(log N) for retrieval, O(1) checking, and O(1) space.
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	We can simulate the recursion approach, but iteratively, and ability to pause the recursion.
 * 
 * 	Idea is this:
 * 		>	Assume we know already the next node to pop. What will come after the node to pop?
 * 		>	If it contains right subtree, then it IS the right subtree's leftmost node.
 * 		>	Otherwise, it must be parent node.
 * 
 * 	Therefore, we will create a Data Structure that stores only the LEFT NODE of the current subtree. Since
 * 	from the root to the leftmost node, we would want to pop the leftmost node first, so we need LIFO - Stack.
 * 
 * 		>	With root node, push the root node and go to its left node. Repeat this while node is not null
 * 		
 * 		>	When we want to pop, check the node has a rightsubtree or not. 
 * 			-	Yes: Treat right node as root node and keep pushing the left node of it while node is not null
 * 					 like above step. So next time we pop is the right subtree's leftmost node and so on
 * 			-	No:	The stack top will now be parent node of current popped node. Next time it can be safely popped
 * 					too
 * 
 * 	This algorithm runs Averagely O(1) (at worst, O(h) node is traversed at retrieval)
 *  time and O(h) space, h is height of tree.
