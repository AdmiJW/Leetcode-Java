/*
 * 	This is a Stack String problem.
 * 
 * 	Well, if previous k characters are the very same character, then obviously we will
 * 	remove that entire group from the string. Problem is, after removing, we must also
 * 	know what is the character before the removed group. Eg:
 * 
 * 		"aabbba", k = 3
 * 	After removing 3 'b', we must also know 3 'a' can be removed next. 
 * 
 * 	This calls for the stack data structure. Imagine the string as a stack. If the stack top
 * 	is k consecutive characters of same type, we can pop them. What remains on top of stack will
 * 	be the characters before the removed group!
 * 
 * 	Since K can be large, it's better to keep a counter instead. For every character,
 * 		>	If stack peek is same character as current one, increment counter for that stack top
 * 		>	Otherwise, push a new character to top of stack, with counter initialized as 1
 * 	Also in each iteration, be sure to check the stack top whether it can be popped, once detect that
 * 	the counter is >= k.
