/*
 * 	This is a DP, Deque problem.
 * 
 * 	Looking at this question if you are a experienced with Dynamic Programming, you immediately know
 * 	to approach the problem bottom up (from back of array), such that we may have recorded dp[i]
 *  which shows the maximum score to reach end starting from index i
 *  
 *  The problem is the jump range of size k. If k is large, it means in each iteration, I have to check
 *  dp array ranging up to size k, thus time complexity of O(NK)
 *  
 *  If you've heard of monotonic dequeue before, it is perfect time to use it here. Each DP result will be
 *  stored in the queue, but we apply a algorithm where the queue will be always strictly decreasing.
 *  In other words, the front of the queue is largest in the queue, and the tail is smallest.
 *  
 *  This is done when we apply the following algorithm to the queue pushing:
 *  
 *  	>	While the element to push is greater than the tail of queue, pop the tail of queue
 *  	>	End of loop, the queue is either empty or the element in it is greater than the element to push.
 *  		Push the element to the tail of queue
 *  
 *  This way, everytime we peek at the front of queue, it is always the maximum DP element!
 *  
 *  One little thing is to check if the element is out of range. This can be done by recording the index as well
 *  and perform checking at each iteration.
