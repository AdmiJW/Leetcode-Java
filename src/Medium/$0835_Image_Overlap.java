/*
 * 	This is a BRUTE FORCE solution. No matter how we think, it shall be impossible to optimize above O(n^4)
 * 
 * 	Given two images, we can perform the transformation of either left, right, up or down. Then, we need to see how many
 * 	overlap of 1's in two images for each transformation
 * 
 * 	The solution would be to iterate through all the transformations.
 * 	Notice that we only need to transform one image, where the other just keep fixed in its place.
 * 
 * 	Let's see the possible transformation and understand better with a 1D array, of size 3
 * 	Edge cases:
 * 
 * 	A	| 1 | 0 | 1 |
 * 	B			| 1 | 0 | 1 |
 * 
 * 	AND
 * 
 * 	A			| 1 | 0 | 1 |
 * 	B	| 1 | 0 | 1 |
 * 
 * 	You can see, the first edge case has transformation X of -2, where the second edge case has transformation X of 2
 * 	>	We map the grid number in A to grid number in B by just adding with the transformation.
 * 		See:	In case 1, the index 2 in A is equivalent to index 0 in B, which is ( 2 + (-2) )
 * 				In case 2, the index 0 in A is equivalent to index 2 in B, which is ( 2 + (2) )
 * 	>	How about those indexes that is out of bounds? In that case, we shall not initialize the loop variable to include the out
 * 		of bounds index. 
 * 		See:	Since in case 1, index 0, 1 in A will map to -2, -1, which is invalid index. In that case,
 * 				the loop shall start from index 2 , and stop right at index 3
 * 				Since in case 2, index 1, 2 in A will map to 3, 4, which is out of bounds index. In that case,
 * 				the loop shall start from 0, and stop right at SIZE - TRANSFORMATION
 * 
 * 	This let us concludes what index we shall loop from, and stop at where
 * 
 * 		for (int i = Math.max(0, 0 - shift);					<-- If the shifting causes it to be negative, start from 0
 * 				i < Math.min( size, size - shift);				<-- If the shifting causes overbound, stop right at size
 * 				i ++ )
 * 
 * 		
 * 	Therefore time complexity:
 * 		>	We iterate through all the shiftings of X, and Y. O(N^2)
 * 		>	For each shifting, we count the occurrences of overlap, meaning we iterate 
 * 			through each grid of both the 2D arrays. O(N^2)
 * 
 * 			In the end, it is O(N^4)
 * 
 * 	================================================================================================================
 * 
 * 	Instead of focusing on shifting, we can focus on the actual grid that contains 1 themselves.
 * 	First we obtain the information on the grid that contains 1 in both 2D arrays, essentially discarding those with 0
 * 
 * 	Then, we generate all the possible transformation matrices. (How much transform X and Y), generated in the same
 * 	manner as above 
 * 	Then for each possible transformation, iterate through all the indices pair of A that contains 1, apply the transformation,
 * 	and see if that transformed indices is contained in B
 * 
 * 	This also has time complexity of O(N^4), with added space complexity of O(N^2). Let's see
 * 	
 * 	>	We generate all the possible trasformation matrices. O(N^2)
 * 	>	We iterate through all the indices pair of A. In worst case A is all 1. Therefore it is O(N^2)
 * 
 * 	Therefore O(N^4)
