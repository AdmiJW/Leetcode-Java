/*
 * This is a binary search / Array / Sorting problem
 * 
 * First of all, my first solution is to use queue and perform a linear scan. For each of the element, we check if it gets
 * closer and closer to x or not. We will keep adding the element into the queue. The queue itself represents our sliding window.
 * 
 * When encounter with a new element, we need to make a decision if we slide the window to include this element, will it be better?
 * If it does not, then since array is sorted, we can early terminate and return result.
 * Otherwise, we need to include this element. Poll the leftmost element if the queue is already size k.
 * 
 * 
 * Because array is sorted, we can perform binary search on it. The binary search shall return the pointer to the closest element
 * to x (Due to how we perform binary search, it can be greatest element that is less than x. In that case, need to compare
 * pt and pt+1 element).
 * Then, starting from that index, we extend the window by comparing the leftmost and rightmost elements until size k is reached.
 * 
 * 	
 * The optimized solution is to perform modified binary search. The idea is, we search for the left index. The possible left indices
 * are in the range [0, len-k]. Start binary search from this range.
 * Each iteration, we obtain the guess index mid. From it, we also check the second guess index mid+k, which is element that directly
 * follows the first guesses' window.
 * Compare the two elements whether which one are more closer. If left index is closer, then the first guess is possible to be the 
 * starting index, thus right = mid. Otherwise, the first guess couldn't be possible because it does not include the second guess
 * that is closer to x. Thus, left = mid +1.
