/*
 * 	This is a linked list, two pointers problem.
 * 
 * 	The inefficient solution is to convert the linked list into array, and swap them. Array allows accessing elements
 * 	through index, but consumes extra space to achieve this solution. Can we do it in O(N) time but O(1) extra space?
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The intuitive solution, is to simply get the length of the linked list, and count the nodes while traversing
 * 	in second pass, record those nodes to swap when the index matches. This solution requires two passes, but still
 * 	is O(N) time and in O(1) extra space
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Another solution, although same two passes required, can be considered. In both passes, we reverse the linked list,
 * 	while keep track of the kth node. At the end, we would require:
 * 		>	head of the reversed linked list
 * 		>	Kth node
 * 
 * 	After first iteration, we obtained first node to swap, and the linked list is reversed. Now if we were to reverse
 * 	the linked list again, it will go back to original. Additionally, if we search the kth element in reversed linked
 * 	list, we would get the second element to swap!
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The best optimal solution involves two pointers. The intuition is, keep a range/window of size k. Example:
 * 
 * 		k = 2 and l = 7
 * 
 * 		(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)
 * 		|-----------|
 * 	Initially, the 'range' end is at the first node to swap. Now let's move the range until the end!
 * 
 * 		(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)	(	)
 * 												|-----------|
 * 	Notice how the start of the range is stopped at the second node to swap? That's exactly the intuition behind
 * 	the two pointers solution!
