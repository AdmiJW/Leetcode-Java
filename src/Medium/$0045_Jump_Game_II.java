/*
 * 	This is a array, greedy problem.
 * 
 * 	Initially, I thought of a DP similar solution, where I have dp array where each index i records the 
 * 	number of jumps required to go from index i to last.
 * 	The base case is at len-1, which is 0.
 * 	For every index i, iterate thru all possible jumps and pick the minumum jump from dp array, +1.
 * 
 * 	Solution takes O(N^2) time, yet O(N) space. Its not good.
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Say [2,3,1,1,4]
 * 	The optimal solution is BFS concepted. Initially, start from index 0. We discover that we can jump from
 * 	index 0, to index range [1,2].
 * 	Therefore count that as one layer. Then, iterate nodes in index [1,2] and determine the furthest reach in the next layer.
 * 	In this case, [1,2] has the jump '3' in index 1, which reaches last index. Therefore the next reach is [3,4].
 * 
 * 	At the end of one layer, set start to be end +1, and end to be whatever further reach is, if you havent reach len-1
