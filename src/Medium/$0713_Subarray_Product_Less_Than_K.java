/*
 * 	A sliding window / Binary search problem.
 * 
 * 	Given those positive integers (No decimals, no negatives). Can we find subarray with good product less than k? In linear time?
 * 
 * 	One intuitive idea to realize is: 
 * 		Given a array of positive integers of length l, say [1,2,3,4,5]. If this array product is less than k, then ALL
 * 		its subarray will be less than k, due to the fact that product of integer only increases value, no decreasing.
 * 
 * 	WIth this fact in mind, we can just iterate through the array using a sliding window, and a product variable keeping track of the
 * 	products in the sliding window.
 * 	Whenever we introduced a new element into sliding window, we will make a promise: Promise to use this latest added element in our
 * 	subarray. Generate all the subarrays with the last element included. Eg:	
 * 		[1,2,3,4] where 4 just be included into the subarray
 * 		Valid subarrays are [4], [3,4], [2,3,4], [1,2,3,4]
 * 	
 * 	Now, if the product of all elements in sliding window is over k, we'll have to shrink the size of sliding window from behind (tail) 
 * 	until it returns back to valid state again (product < k).
 * 	When it is ready, we have a valid sliding window which products inside it is less than k. Count number of subarrays with latest
 * 	element included in it, which is given by (head - tail + 1)
 * 
 * 	The sum of all those valid subarrays is the overall answer to the problem
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Multiplying is dangerous. If sliding window is large, it can result in a datatype overflow. Int datatype may be too small to contain the
 * 	product. In extreme cases, even long can't handle it.
 * 	
 * 	That's where we use the knowledge of logarithms.
 * 
 * 	>	Apply log to each element
 * 	>	Create a new array which is cumulative sum (Running sum) of the logarithms.
 * 		Eg:	log 10 = 1;
 * 		Original: [10,10,10]
 * 		Running sum: [0, 1, 2, 3]		<< Created a extra space for convenience, and easier for binary search
 * 
 * 	Key point to realize: Now since it is running sum, it basically SORTED, which means binary search is applicable.
 * 	
 * 	Like above solution, we need to find valid subarrays involving the latest element. The property of sums of logarithms is:
 * 		
 * 		log a + log b + lob c =====> log (abc)		Its their product!
 * 	
 * 	If we also apply log to the K value, then we have to find
 * 			log (...n) < log (K) 
 * 
 * 	We need to use binary search to find the index where when excluded, the product is smaller than log (K)
 * 	Basically,
 * 			Find index where
 * 		log( current sum) - log (binary index) < log (K)
 * 
 * 	This has time of O(N log N), but deals with integer overflow problem
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	We've explored logarithms. What if logarithms is used in sliding window approach?
