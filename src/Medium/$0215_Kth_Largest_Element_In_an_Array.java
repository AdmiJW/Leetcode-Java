//https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

/*
 * 	This is a Heap problem / Quick Partition (Divide and Conquer) problem
 * 
 * 	The easiest solution is just sort it and return the element at that position. O(N log N)
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	We can also use the priority queue method which is a heap. Since it asks for the maximum kth element, what we
 * 	mostly don't want is small elements, therefore we would use a MIN HEAP, to allow us to discard any minimum elements
 * 	immediately once the heap exceed the size of K.
 * 	
 * 	The remaining elements in the heap will consists of first K maximum elements. When we are done iteration, the top of the
 * 	heap is immediately our answer.
 * 
 * 	Heap's insertion and heapify is O(log K) therefore taking overall time complexity O(N log K) and space O(K)
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	One ingenious solution is to using the partition algorithm in quick sort method. The partition algorithm allows us to
 * 	find out the position of one single pivot element as if it is in a sorted array.
 * 	
 * 	Since we are finding the Kth maximum element, if it is found that the index of pivot is exactly match, immediately return
 * 	the pivot as we had found the answer
 * 
 * 	If it is not, it's nevermind as we can immediately narrow down the range. Since hopefully the pivot element is exactly in
 * 	middle of the array, then we can cut half the range that we are searching.
 * 
 * 	Let I be the index of pivot. If the supposed index is greater than I, then just recurse on the right side of the array.
 * 	Otherwise, just recurse on the left side.
 * 
 * 	On worst case where pivot element is always at end, it should be O(N^2) time. Otherwise it can go to O(N) time in best case with
 * 	proven (Find online)
