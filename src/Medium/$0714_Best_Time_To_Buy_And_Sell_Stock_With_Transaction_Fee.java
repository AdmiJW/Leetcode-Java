/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming Problem, very, very similar to problem "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II".
 * 
 * 	Again, this problem is best represented with state diagram. The very same algorithm is used in the problem stated
 * 	above, except now it introduced the transaction fee.
 * 	However, don't let that scare you. LITERALLY THE VERY SAME ALGORITHM WORKS, just take into account the transaction
 * 	fee, and you are done with this problem.
