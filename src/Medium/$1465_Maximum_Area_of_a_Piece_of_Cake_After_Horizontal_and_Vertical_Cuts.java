/*
 * 	This is a Array problem
 * 	PS: I came up with the solution while bathing. Nice place to think of solution
 * 
 * 	The problem might seem a bit difficult, but after realizing one fact, it seems easy now:
 * 		>	Let's perform all verticalCuts on the cake first. What will you be left with?
 * 
 * 	The answer is stripes of cakes! If we were to take largest area, of course it is the one
 * 	with the largest gap between cuts!
 * 	Say I cut the cake at [1,3,8,10], the largest stripe is of width 5, because 8-3 is 5.
 * 	
 * 	To determine the width of largest gap cake, simply sort the cuts, and you can calculate the gaps
 * 	fairly easily by a linear iteration. Don't forget the both ends!
 * 
 * 	Now, forget about other stripes and focus only on the largest stripe of cake. Now I'll perform all horizontal
 * 	cuts. As you can see, now it is easy to find out the maximum block cake!
