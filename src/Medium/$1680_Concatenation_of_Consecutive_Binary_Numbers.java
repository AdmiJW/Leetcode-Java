/*
 * 	This is mainly a bitwise manipulation problem.
 * 
 * 	From 1 to N, we have to concatenate each binary string representation together, and get the final
 * 	value modulo 10^9 + 7
 * 
 * 	How can we simulate the concatenation process without creating the actual string? By using bit shifting
 * 	
 * 	First, we have to know the length of a particular number to know how much places to shift. This can be
 * 	done via loops, or via logarithm. 
 * 
 * 	Then, once the space is cleared to be able to add the current number, add it, and remember to perform
 * 	modulo so it doesn't overflow!
