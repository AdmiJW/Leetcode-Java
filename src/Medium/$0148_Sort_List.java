/*
 * 	We have a lot of sorting algorithms for arrays, which provided O(1) random access time. However, problem arises when
 * 	we are trying to sort a Linked List. With random access of element taking O(N), how would we perform a sort in
 *  O(N log N)?
 *  
 *  One of solution is MERGE SORT, which uses DIVIDE AND CONQUER algorithm.
 *  
 *  For a linked list, we can split it into two halves. They essentially become 2 new linked lists, and with recursion,
 *  they will be returning those 2 linked lists, in sorted manner. Now we have to merge those 2 sorted linked list into
 *  1, by iterating through them with two seperate pointers.
 *  
 *	Merge sort basically have 3 steps:
 *		>	Splitting
 *		>	Recursion to Obtain sorted
 *		>	Merging
 *
 *	First of all, the base case is when the linked list contains only 1 nodes. In that case the linked list is technically
 *	SORTED. So just return this node as the head of SORTED LIST
 *
 *	For splitting, we have to split linked list into 2 equal parts. This can be done by first obtain the length of linked
 *	list then split it. Or the other way, we use a fast pointer which moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. When the
 *	fast pointer had hit the end of linked list, the slow pointer would be pointing at the halfway of linked list.
 *
 *	Then, we call upon the recursive function on those 2 linked lists. We can expect them to return 2 sorted linked lists.
 *	
 *	With those 2 sorted linked lists, we can MERGE them. By having 2 pointers, 1 at each linked list, we can compare the
 *	2 nodes and prioritize the one with smaller value to be put first. Iterate until both linked list's nodes have been
 *	used up
 *
 * 	Due to us splitting the linked list into halves in each recursion, the recursion itself would occur for O(lg N) times.
 * 	In each recursion, we perform splitting - O(N), and merging - O(N). So the overall time complexity is
 * 	O(N log N), while for space is the space taken up by recursion calls, of O(lg N)
 * 
 * 	==================================================================================================================
 * 
 * 	If we didn't use recursion, it would have been a O(1) space solution.
 * 
 * 	In the above recursive method, it is a top-down approach merge sort - We started with full length L, then L/2, then L/4
 * 	until they have been reduced to size 1.
 * 	In the iterative method, it will be a bottom-up approach. We assume initially the linked list is all sublists of
 * 	size 1, which is sorted of their own. Then we would merge them in PAIRS of sublist. See:
 * 
 * 		(5)-(4)-(2)-(1)
 * 	We initially assume they are all sorted lists, of size 1. Then we would merge them together, in PAIRS:
 * 	1. Merge (5)-(4)
 * 		>	(4,5)-(2)-(1)
 * 	2. Merge (2)-(1)
 * 		>	(4,5)-(1,2)
 * 	
 * 	Now they have been merged from sublists of size 1, into SORTED LISTS of at most size 2. Then we further merge them
 * 	1. Merge (4,5) and (1,2)
 * 		>	(1,2,4,5)
 * 
 * 	After this had been done, we can simply return the linked list now.
