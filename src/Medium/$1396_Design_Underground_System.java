/*
 * 	This is simply a Design problem.
 * 
 * 	When you check in, you get the customer's ID, board station and the time. You don't know about when the customer
 * 	will check out the train. So you have to store them first!
 * 	
 * 	The key is obviously the customer's ID. However we have to store the boarding station and time. Since they are different
 * 	datatypes, we either use Pair<> object, or create our own class for that.
 * 
 * 	When board off, look up the boarding info from the above Hashmap. Then, we can immediately store the information about
 * 	the times.
 * 	For some efficiency, store the boarding-checkout station names into single string. Another HashMap will be storing the
 * 	"boarding-checkout" string as key, and it points an integer array of size 2 (again, you can use Pair).
 * 	The integer array is [ total time, no of customers ]
