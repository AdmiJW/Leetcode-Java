/*
 * Similar concept as the unique path I question. Except for this one, if there is any obstacle in the deepest row or rightmost column, then any grid to the left
 * or above, will end up as 0 ways.
 * 
 * As for intermediate grids, if we see an obstacle, we will simply mark this path as 0 instead of sum of right + below. Therefore when the grid sees the obstacle,
 * it knows there are 0 ways if he choose to move to the obstacle
 * 
 * 	This one we can make a 2D array, or better 1D array to solve as in unique path I solution. However, since the obstacleGrid itself is passed into the function,
 * 	we can just use that 2D grid passed in and resulting in O(1) space complexity solution
