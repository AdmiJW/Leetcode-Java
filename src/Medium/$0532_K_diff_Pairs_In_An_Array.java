//https://leetcode.com/problems/k-diff-pairs-in-an-array/

/*
 * 	This problem is asking for number of unique pairs which has difference of K. Note that pairs must be unique, therefore
 * 	for [1,1,2] and K = 1, the answer shall be 1, not 2.
 * 
 * 	One slower solution is to use sorting and binary search. Basically for each number, we need to check if its complement (which forms
 * 	up to difference K) is exist in the array.	
 * 	However, be careful about duplicates because [1,2] and [2,1] are same and we shall not count it twice. This can be allevated by enforcing
 * 	a rule: We assume that the number chosen is greater than the other pair. This will ensure that only on the greater element we will be
 * 	performing the search on, not on the smaller element and thus, no duplicates
 * 	Since the elements are sorted, We only have to perform binary search on the left side of the array. Also, as soon as we find out the
 * 	value to be searched is greater than the element selected, we skip the search directly.
 * 
 * 	Time complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting, but it takes only O(1), if we sort in place.
 * 
 * 	==============================================================================================================
 * 
 * 	We could trade off some space for time. We basically have to keep track of the frequency table of the array in a Hash Table.
 * 	
 * 	The reason for keeping track of frequency instead of using Set is because in special case of K = 0, we need to see if the element
 * 	contain multiple copies of itself in the original array.
 * 
 * 	After frequency table is done, we iterate over all the keys, skipping those elements which search value is greater than element itself.
 * 	If the K is 0, check if the selected element has multiple copies of itself.
 * 	Else, just check if the array contains the search value, which shall me smaller than the selected element.
 * 
 * 	Time complexity is O(N) and same for space complexity.
