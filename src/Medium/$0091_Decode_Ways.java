/*
 *	This is actually a Dynamic Programming problem, which is harder to observe
 *	PS: I observed it when 
 *			>	Case "1": 1
 *			>	Case "11": 2
 *			>	Case "111": 3
 *			>	Case "1111": 5
 *			>	Case "11111": 8
 *	This is FIBONACCI SEQUENCE ------- Dynamic Programming
 *
 *	-------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	For each character, we can have choice to make it:
 *		>	Alone
 *		>	Pair with previous character
 *
 *	The number of ways to pair characters should be (alone + pair with previous character).
 *	The DP array should represent for the index, corresponds to the substring until index i, the number of ways to decode
 *	the string. Index -1 and 0 is initialized to 1, since one digit can only have 1 way to decode (Except digit 0)
 *
 *	Then,
 *
 *	For making the character alone, we just have to obtain the PREVIOUS CHARACTER'S WAYS OF DECODE ( DP[i-1] )
 *	However, we cannot make character alone when the character is '0'
 *
 *	For making the character pair with previous, then we obtain the PREVIOUS TWO CHARACTER'S WAY OF DECODE (DP[i-2] )
 *	However, we cannot make character pair when previous character is '0' or they sum up exceed 26.
 *
 *	At the end, the last element of DP array is the answer
 *
 *	-----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	Note that we only use DP[i-2] and DP[i-1]. Thus solution can optimize to only use array of size 2, making O(1) space
 *	complexity
