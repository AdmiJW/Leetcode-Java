/*
 * 	This is a Reservoir Sampling Problem, which is a statistics / probability problem, not really related to programming
 * 
 * 	Given a buffer of data (Represented by linked list), we have to pick out nodes randomly and return value of it.
 * 	Every node must have approximately same probability of being chosen.
 * 
 * 	Since it is a buffer, means we are unable to find out the length of the whole data. We shouldn't store the whole buffer
 * 	in the memory first and randomly select, as the buffer itself may be very large to store entirely in the memory.
 * 	
 *	Therefore in real situation, a O(N) time complexity is a must. We have to at least iterate through each node of the list.
 *
 *	How would we go about selecting random nodes then, if we are just iterating forward? Flipping coins?
 *	Holding a node, we receive the next element. If we are to flip the coin to decide whether the element should be replaced
 *	or not, it is not random.
 *		>	The first coin should be always selected first. As the N size goes larger, the probability of first element
 *			being replaced increases, and thus probability of it selected is going to be smaller.
 *
 *	Therefore, what if we assign a random number to each of the nodes, and pick out the node with the maximum random number?
 *	That indeed is a random way. In the case of selecting 1 node only, the time complexity is O(N). In each node we iterate,
 *	a random number is generated. If it is greater than the one we holding, replace it.
 *
 *	However if we were to select k elements, we should be using a heap instead where the element's assigned random number is
 *	the sorting key in the heap. The heap will be of size k and at last, it shall contain the k most maximum random number
 *	assigned nodes. The time complexity rises to O(N log N)
 *
 *	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	There is a better way than just assigning each element random numbers, which is reservoir sampling.
 *	In this method, we still have to traverse through all the nodes in the list. However, we need not to know
 *	any information about the linked list (length) to ensure that every node has probability of 1/n to be chosen.	
 *
 *	If I have 3 elements:
 *		>	Element 1 shall always be selected and held first.
 *		>	What is the probability that element 2 shall replace element 1?
 *				The answer is 1/2. It has half the chance of replacing
 *		>	What is the probability that element 3 shall replace whatever we are holding?
 *				The answer turns out to be 1/3. Let's see:
 *
 *		The probability of Elem 1 Selected is: P(select elem 1) * P(e1 not being replaced)
 *		The probability of Elem 2 Selected is: P(select elem 2) * P(e2 not being replaced)
 *		The probability of Elem 3 Selected is: P(select elem 3)
 *		and each of these probability must be equal = 1/n
 *
 *	Perhaps the probability that we should assign to selecting Nth node is 1/n?
 *
 *	P(select elem1) is 1. 
 *	Then, P(e1 not replaced) turns out to be P(e2 NOT selected) * P(e3 NOT selected).
 *							= COMPLEMENT( P(e2 selected) ) * COMPLEMENT( P(e3 selected) )
 *		  P(e1 not replaced) = (1/2) * (2/3)
 *
 *	Surely, P(e1 not replaced) is then (1-P(e2 selected)) * (1-P(e3 selected)) * .... * (1-P(eN selected)) for N length list.
 *
 *	which is (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * ... * (1 - 1/n)
 *
 *	Now, turns out by simplification using algebra, equation
 *			P(e1) = P(e1 selected) * P(e2 not selected) * P(e3 not selected) ... P(eN not selected)
 *	can be simplified to
 *			1/n
 *
 *	That means all the element has equal probability of being chosen! (This can be more easily proven by induction)
 *
 *	Similarly, P(e2 not replaced) = P(e3 NOT selected)
 *								  = (2/3)
 *
 *	-----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	Therefore for selecting k elements, a random int from 1 to current index is selected. If it is less than k,
 *	we immediately place the current element in the array of index random number generated.
