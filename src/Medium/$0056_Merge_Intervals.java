/*
 * 	This is a interval arrays problem, which mostly involves sorting
 * 
 * 	Given a list of intervals and we have to sort them. First of all, those intervals may be jumbled up, so we
 * 	have to sort them so that from left to right it is easier to see and process
 * 
 * 	Sort by the interval start point is enough. 
 * 
 * 	We will have a pivot interval at all times, which is the interval that has the lowest "local" start point.
 * 	The next intervals may be merged, so we have to check it.
 * 	While the next interval's start point is less than previous interval's end point, the interval may be merged
 * 	and we update the end pointer to be maximum of end pointer itself or the current intervals end point.
 * 
 * 	The time when we need to actually proceed to new pointer is when the next interval's start point is greater than
 * 	the recorded end point. Then, push the last recorded interval into result, and proceed to the new interval.
