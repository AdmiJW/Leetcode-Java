/*
 * This is a Hash Table (HashMap), PriorityQueue / Sorting problem which revolves around idea of Greedy Algorithm
 * 
 * 	If I want to remove an integer, of course I want to remove the one with largest frequency first. This is greedy
 * 	To achieve this, I must obtain the frequencies of all elements in the array beforehand.
 * 	Then, from the frequencies, sort them in decreasing order, then always remove the largest element first. That's it
 * 
 * 	Overall time complexity is O(N log N)
