/*
 * This is said to be a greedy problem, but I say it is a logic and proof question.
 * 
 * 	We can only add 1 to a place number each time. Eg: 1001 will definitely add 1 at the thousandth place and oneth place.
 * 	Therefore, the solution is to actually find out how many times I actually had to add to a number place. Like:
 * 	800192. We are forced to add 9 Deci Binary numbers, because at tenths place, I am required to add 1 by 9 times!
 * 	
 * You might argue for the case that adding carry may affect the result, but that is a relatively easy proof:
 * 	
 * 	Say to reach 9, the quickest way is to add 1 by 9 times. So far, our algorithm would take maximum result of 9.
 * 	To achieve a carry, one must add for 9+1 = 10, which takes 10 times! Not optimal. Thus proven that our greedy method
 * 	works perfectly
