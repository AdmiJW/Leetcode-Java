/*
 * 	This is a Binary Search problem with usage of HashMap.
 * 
 * 	We are going to sort the interval array, but the solution require us to put the answer in the correct index. Therefore
 * 	we first create the HashMap, mapping from each array object to the original index
 * 	
 * 	Then, we have to sort the interval arrays by their interval start point in order to allow us to use the binary 
 * 	search technique itself.
 * 
 * 	For each interval, since we have to find the interval where the starting position is greater than or equal to this interval's
 * 	end point, we have to search for it. Luckily, the array is sorted by starting position so we can just binary ssearch on the
 * 	right side of the current interval to find it in log(n) time
 * 
 * 	Notice the property of binary search:
 * 
 * 		>	If we are on the last interval in the array, the left will wound up at non-existent position (Overflow), while right
 * 			points to the last element in array, which is the interval itself
 * 		>	If there are no valid interval, both left pointer and right pointer will be at the interval element next to the 
 * 			selected interval. However, that interval is not the answer
 * 
 * 		Therefore we can conclude that:
 * 		>	By using Right pointer instead of left pointer, we avoid ourselves of array out of bound error (When last element is selected)
 * 		>	Check each time the answer selected is indeed a valid answer. By checking the answer interval's starting point 
 * 
 * 	Then, using HashMap, find the original index of the answer interval back and put in the selected interval's index
