/*
 * 	This is a binary search problem.
 * 
 * 	Given a array is rotated, we should find out where is the starting point of the original sorted array, which has the
 * 	smallest element
 * 
 * 	This can be done using binary search. For each selected middle element, if the middle element is greater than the
 * 	right element, then the pivot must be in between mid and right, excluding mid. Otherwise, it must be either mid itself
 * 	or to the left
 * 
 * 	Having the pivot point index, we have two choices:
 * 		>	Everything to left of pivot is sorted, same goes for to the right of pivot. Perform regular binary search
 * 			for two of those subarray, and merge results
 * 		>	Apply index shifting when doing the binary search. Careful of index out of bounds!
