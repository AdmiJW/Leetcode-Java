/*
 * 	This is a linked list problem, where linked list usually relates to two pointers
 * 
 * 	Say linked list is length L
 * 	Make a fast pointer that is N steps ahead of the head node. Then, while fast pointer is not reached
 * 	the end, move both slow and fast pointer. At the end, fast pointer will be at Lth node, and slow pointer
 * 	will be at L - Nth node, which is the node we want to delete!
 * 
 * 	Edge case is when L = N, then we detect it when fast pointer is already null to begin with after moving.
 * 	Then, simply return head.next
