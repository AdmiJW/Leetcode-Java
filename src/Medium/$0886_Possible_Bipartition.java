/*
 * 	This is a graph theory, BIPARPITE GRAPH problem with DFS/BFS solving algorithm. The disliking relationship of the peoples can be 
 * 	represented in a graph, and the graph's pointer will be double sided (double arrow). Notice that when the graph is drawn, when we jump
 * 	from a node to another, it switches team.
 * 	Eg:				O <--------> O <---------> O <-------------> O
 * 				Group 1		Group 2			Group 1			Group 2
 * 
 * 	It works as follows: For each person we would color it in RED, and the people that the person dislikes, will be colored in BLUE, which
 * 	depicts 2 opposite teams.
 * 	Initially, the graph will be uncolored. Therefore we implement a hash map that points the person's number (KEY) to its color (MAP)
 *  
 *  We do this using DFS/BFS such that after coloring the current person, we would want to try and color each people that person dislikes, in
 *  opposite color. If a particular person is already colored (exists in map already), we would need to check if the person matches the supposed
 *  color that it should have. If there is a conflict (Eg: We want to color this person BLUE but it is already colored RED), 
 *  that's a sign that it is impossible to contain them all in just 2 teams.
 *  
 *  We don't have to care about if one particular disliked person is the source/parent (where the source of the search) because it would have matched
 *  the supposed color to paint
 *
