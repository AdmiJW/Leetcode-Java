/*
 * One quick way to solve, is to actually sort the entire array, and compare both the sorted and unsorted arrays.
 * The leftmost mismatch is the start of the unsorted subarray, and the rightmost mismatch is the end of unsorted
 * subarray
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * A sorted array is always increasing. Meaning, the next element is always larger than all the elements, including
 * the largest one, in the previously seen elements.
 * 
 * Therefore, perform a linear scan. If the next element is larger than largest, then nevermind, the array is fine
 * 
 * If it is however smaller than largest, it can be either of two cases:
 * 
 * >	Smaller than the smallest element in unsorted subarray. That means like: 1,2, (5,4), -1
 * 		The (5,4) is unsorted segment, and smallest is 4. Since -1 is already smaller than 4, we have to extend the
 * 		starting point of the unsorted subarray until (1,2,5,4, -1)
 * 
 * >	Larger than the smallest element in unsorted subarray. In this case simply extend the end point. No need to 
 * 		extend starting point
