/*
 * 	A Linked list problem. We are asked to rotate the linked list, as follows:
 * 	
 * 		A -> B -> C
 * 		C -> A -> B
 * 		B -> C -> A
 * 		A -> B -> C
 * 	Basically, we are rotating it to the right, so that each rotation, last element become the first
 * 	element (head), and last second element become the tail.
 * 
 * 	THe problem was originally solved in Linked_List problem. Do refer to that!
