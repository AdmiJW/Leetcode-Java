/*
 * 	This is a Design, Stack problem
 * 
 * 	First, we need to know what is an iterator. An iterator is essentially just a structure that keeps a reference
 * 	to the original array, as well as a progress index. So when we call next(), it returns the element at progress index,
 * 	and increment the progress index.
 * 
 * 	Now, the elements may be another list as well. The problem is recursive in nature. Therefore, to emulate the effect
 * 	of recursion, we use Stack.
 * 
 * 	In my solution, I didn't realize that I can use built in iterator, therefore I used 2 stacks: One to store array and
 * 	another to store progress index.
 * 
 * 								   AB       C
 * 	Say I have the following list: [[1,2],3,[4,5]] where I marked each list with alphabet
 * 	At the first element, it is another list, so I store the outer list A index 0 into the stack so I don't lose reference to it,
 * 	and proceed to push B with index 0 as well. Now index 0 at B is a integer, so I am ok with current state. The value can 
 * 	be retrieved immediately
 * 
 * 	Stack: [ (A,0), (B,0) ] < top
 * 
 * 	When I call next(), 1 shall be returned, while incrementing the progress of B by 1:
 * 	Stack: [ (A,0), (B,1) ] < top
 * 
 * 	next() once more, we realize that the index goes out of bound for B. So pop B, it's time to progress A
 * 	Stack: [ (A,1) ] < top
 * 
 * 	next(), realize that index 2 is a nested list, so push A index 2 into stack, and also C index 0
 * 	Stack: [ (A,2), (C,0) ] < top
 * 
 * 	after 2 times next(), realize C out of bound, so pop C. Also when we try to proceed A, it is also out of bound,
 * 	so we are popping A as well. Now stack is empty
 * 	Stack: [] < top
 * 	That's how we know when it is ended.
 * 
 * 	-----------------------
 * 
 * 	Theres still a problem with above approach. See when a list is empty, we have to know to proceed!
 *	Eg: [ [], [], [1] ]
 *	Initially when we set up, it must already point at '1'!
 *
 *	Therefore when we push nested list, if we detect that the list is empty, we can call next() immediately
 *	to proceed.
 *
 *	Of course, saying is easier than action
