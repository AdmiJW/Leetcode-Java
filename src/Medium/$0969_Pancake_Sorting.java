/*
 * 	This is a Sorting Problem
 * 	
 * 	Notice the property of a pancake flip: We will always be flipping a prefix of the array, no matter what k we choose
 * 
 * 	Therefore, to sort the array, we can utilize the similar approach to Selection Sort.
 * 	Recall that how Selection sort works:
 * 		>	Iterate through the array to find the maximum value which shall be at the end of array
 * 		>	Swap it with the last element in the array
 * 		>	Repeat the process but with the sub-array which is length N - 1. (Excluding the last swapped element)
 * 
 * 	With pancake flipping, we can perform the similar technique as well, but with additional steps:
 * 		>	Iterate through the array to find the maximum value
 * 		>	Since pancake flipping the array from idx 0 up to the index of the maximum value causes the maximum value to be
 * 			reversed to the first element, do it
 * 		>	With the maximum element as the front element, reverse the entire (sub)-array, so that the maximum element will be
 * 			reversed to it's supposed place.
 * 		>	Shrink the array by size 1
 *
