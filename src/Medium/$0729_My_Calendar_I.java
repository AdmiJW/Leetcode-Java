/*
 * 	This can be thought of as a Binary Search Tree problem?
 * 
 *	A task can only be inserted if it is not overlapping with any other tasks. We have to think of 
 *	a data structure that let us perform checking for overlapping, and insertion in fast time.
 *
 *	For brute force, we only keep a list of tasks. Everytime we have to insert a task, iterate through
 *	each previously inserted task and see if they overlap or not.
 *	If none of the tasks overlap, we are safe to say that the task is not overlapping and append to the list.
 *	This apporach however takes O(N^2) time.
 *
 *	A Binary Search Tree with balanced feature, like Java's TreeMap (Red black tree) is good for this.
 *	It is able to let us search for floorkey and ceilingkey time as well as insertion in
 *	O(log N) time. Check if both floorkey and ceilingkey task is overlapping or not. If not, it is safe
 *	to say the task can be safely inserted.
