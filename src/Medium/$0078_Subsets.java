/*
 * 	One solution is to use what is known as Cascading, which is more similar to dynamic programming approach (USing subproblems and previously
 * 		computed solutions)
 * 
 * 	Initialize a list of results that will be returned at the end of the function. Add a default empty set into it.
 * 	Now we will loop a linear pass through the list of integers, selecting one integer at a time.
 * 	For each selected integer, it is going to be appended to all the lists in the result list.
 * 	Therefore a simulation run for [1,2,3]:
 * 		Intermission: () + []
 * 		1 Selected: ( [] ) + [1]
 * 		2 Selected: ( [], [1] ) + [2], [1,2]
 * 		3 Selected: ( [], [1], [2], [1,2] ) + [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]
 * 	Remember it needs to make a copy of each item from the result list each time, resulting in O(N) time
 * 	
 * 	The overall time complexity is O(N * 2^n) because we have to loop it for 2^n times, and N is the time taken to copy array
 * 	The space complexity is O(N * 2^n) as well because the 2^n is the number of combinations there is for the result array, and
 * 		N is for the size of integers that each individual list hold, which in worst case is, all the integers
 * 
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Another solution is to use bitmask of size n. Each bits are 0 representing absence of this element and 1 representing presence of this
 * 	element. We can generate it easily because we know the last permutation must be all 1's, and the number of permutation is known for
 * 	2^n. We just initialize a int from 0, add all the way up to 2^n - 1 inclusive (totaling up to 8 permutations)
 * 
 * 	Then for each permutation we check for each bit one by one if we shall include this integer inside our current set or not.
