/*
 * 	This is an array Greedy problem.
 * 
 * 	For this problem, say we have a value from B, v2, we would pair with a number in A such that the value is still
 * 	larger than v2, but is least larger. 
 * 	Also, if v2 cannot be paired anymore with any other number in A, we would pair it with the smallest number available
 * 
 * 	Therefore, how can we perform such search easily? One way is to use TreeMap.
 * 	With Treemap, we give it values of B, and hopefully it returns the least larger value to one number in A. We store it 
 * 	such that the value also counts frequencies in A. Once frequeny hit 0, delete that value as no more is available in A.
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Best way is to do sorting. Sort A in ascending order and keep 2 pointers at both ends of it.
 * 	Then, sort B in descending order. The idea is:
 * 		>	Deal with largest element in B first. Because:
 * 			>	If it cannot be dealt with, pair with smallest number of A (left pointer of A)
 * 			>	If it can be dealt with, we can pair with largest in A as currently it is largest in B already. No worries
