/*
 * 	This is a HashSet, Bit Manipulation problem
 * 
 * 	We have to check if all permutations of the bit string of size k exists as substring in string s.
 * 	By thinking, the total number of permutations will be 2^k in size. Also, since the size is always
 * 	fixed, we can run a sliding window (some call it rolling hash technique) to update the bit string
 * 	in our window.
 * 
 * 	Say k is 5 and current window is 10101. The next bit is 1. We will be left shifting the window by 
 * 	1 time, so it becomes 101010. Now for the LSB, since last bit is 1, we add 1 so LSB becomes 1 as well.
 * 	Now, discard the MSB. THis can be done via AND operation with a mask of all 1.
 * 	The mask would be 11111, which is easily obtained by 100000 - 1 = (1 << 5) - 1
 * 
 * 	Since there are 2^k total permutations, we can ignore the individual values, and record them in a
 * 	HashSet. At the end, simply check if the HashSet size is 2^k.
 * 
 * 	Instead of Hashset, one can also use a boolean array and a count down counter for improved performance
 * 	due to lower level of abstraction.
