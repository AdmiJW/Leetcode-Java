/*
 * 	This is a Binary Tree, Depth First Search, Recursion problem.
 * 
 * 	Let's revise some key concepts:
 * 	>	In a BST, right subtree's every nodes are greater than parent.
 * 	>	Left subtree are, however, less than parent.
 * 
 *	Therefore think, what value shall one node be incremented with? The answer is the right subtree's sum.
 *	We will call recurse on right subtree, obtain its subtree sum, update the node.val, and pass right subtree
 *	sum + node.val (before modified) into left subtree. This is In order traversal
 *
 *	Every recursion call will assiciate with a parameter sum, which represents the sum value derived from parent and
 *	its right subtree. Recurse right to obtain the sum, update node.val, then return the sum after recurse into left
 *	subtree.
 *
 *	Turns out, instead of returning the sum, we can just return the TreeNode, since the TreeNode does have the value needed
 *	to update the parent node
 *
 *	-----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	Iterative solution is workable especially with Stack. This way just keep a variable sum that keeps adding, and we
 *	use in order traversal to update the nodes.
