/*
 * 	This is a common linked list, two pointers problem
 * 
 * 	From the original linked list, we would like to construct
 * 	2 new linked lists. One with all nodes value lesser than x,
 * 	another with nodes value greater or equal to x.
 * 	At the end, simply connect the two together
 * 
 * 	Iterate through the original linked list, check the nodes value
 * 	and append to either of the two newly created linked list's tail
