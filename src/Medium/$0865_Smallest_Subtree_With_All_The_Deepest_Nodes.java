//https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/

/*
 * 	This is a DFS Postorder Traversal / BFS + DCA (Deepest (or lowest) Common Ancestor) problem
 * 
 * 	Firstly, observe the following:
 * 	For every node, it may contain the following cases:
 * 		>	It has the deepest node in left subtree ONLY
 * 		>	It has the deepest node in right subtree ONLY
 * 		>	It has the deepest node in both subtree
 * 		>	It has none subtree which has the deepest node
 * 
 * 	If say that we know, on a node, the maximum depth of its left subtree and right subtree, what action can we do?
 * 
 * 		>	If the left subtree and right subtree reports a depth which is equal to the maximum depth, that means
 * 			both the subtree contains the deepest node! Therefore we conclude that this node is the deepest common
 * 			ancestor. Record
 * 		>	If the left subtree only that reports a depth, surely that in the left subtree there are LOWER node
 * 			which is the deepest common ancestor. Do nothing. Similar case goes to right subtree.
 * 	
 * 	Therefore we can modify the normal depth searching algorithm. When it returns the depth of subtree from both
 * 	sides, we can check and determine the correct action. Except for this:
 * 	
 * 		>	If the left subtree or right subtree returned highest depth seen so far (Breaking the record), then
 * 			current node will be the DCA, and we have to update the maximum depth. This case particularly occurs
 * 			on leaf node. 
 * 			When encountered a NULL node, we can just return the depth passed in as argument back.
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The idea of the BFS + DSA solution is to
 * 		>	First locate the DEEPEST leftmost node and DEEPEST rightmost node using BFS. The first node and 
 * 			last node in the queue of last level will be it.
 * 		>	Using this 2 informations, we can run a recursive function to find out the deepest common ancestor
 * 			of those 2 nodes:
 * 		
 * 				>	If node is null (Not found), or node is equal to deepest rightmost node or deepest leftmost
 * 					node, return node.
 * 				>	Otherwise recurse on left and right subtree. Obtain the return values
 * 				>	If left and right subtree both returns some value (Means the deepest nodes are found in both
 * 					sides), THIS NODE is the deepest common ancestor. Return current node.
 * 				>	If left subtree returns null, that means (probably) the deepest node is at the right subtree.
 * 				>	COnversely, return left subtree value if right subtree value is null.
