/*
 * 	THis question can be confusing. The weight here actually means 'probability'. Therefore an array of [1,3,4,6] has 4 indexes from 0 to 3.
 * 	We have to randomly select an index to return each time pickIndex() is called such that the probability an index is selected is calculated
 * 	from formula (weight of index) / (Total weight).
 * 	In this case total weight is 1+3+4+6 = 14. Thus,
 * 			P(0) = 1/14
 * 			P(1) = 3/14
 * 			P(2) = 4/14
 * 			P(3) = 6/14
 * 	where P(X) = probability of index X being selected
 * 
 * 	When working with this kind where we have to randomly choose an index, we can make use of cumulative sum array of weight, and binary search
 * 	to search the range.
 * 
 * 	The cumulative sum array of weight would be [1,4,8,14], and we would generate a number in each call. The ranges would fall in as follows:
 * 		[1,1] [2,4] [5,8] [9,14] < Observe that it is inclusive of the above array value
 * 
 * 	Therefore we would use a binary search to find the range
 * 
 * 	Initialization of array uses O(n) time, and each call to search uses O(log n), overall is O(n) time
