/*
 * 	Given a set of possible pair of coordinates available from the rectangles, we shall choose one from those possible coordinates
 * 	randomly, such that each coordinates has equal chance to being choosen
 * 
 * 	Now if we were to choose a rectangle first, then only choose a point from the rectangle, then each point wouldn't have the
 * 	equal chance to be selected. Since each rectangle has equal chance to be selected, regardless of their size,
 * 	each individual point in the larger rectangle actually has smaller chance to being selected
 * 
 * 	To solve this problem, larger rectangle deserves larger chance of being selected than the smaller rectangle.
 * 	This is done by setting up a cumulative area array, Eg if we have rectangles of area 10, 20, 30:
 * 
 * 		Cumulative area array:		10, 30, 60
 * 
 * 	Then we will generate a random int from 1 to 60 inclusive.
 * 		1 - 10:	Rect 1
 * 		11 - 30: Rect 2
 * 		31 - 60: Rect 3
 * 
 * 	With this, we will do binary search to find the respective rectangle. We will find the least element which has value larger than
 * 	or equal to the target value. Eg:	15 will belong to Rect 2, and 60 will belong to Rect 3
 * 
 * 	Therefore If the mid value is smaller than the target, then left = mid + 1 (mid couldn't be the value)
 * 			If the mid value is larger than or equal to target, then right = mid (mid could be the value)
 * 
 * 	With that, we can choose a rectangle with bias, where larger triangle will have larger chance of being selected
 *
