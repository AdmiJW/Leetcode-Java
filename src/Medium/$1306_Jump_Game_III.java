/*
 *	This is a graph DFS/BFS problem with possible recursion implementation
 *
 *	From a node with a specific value, I can jump to the node of index i - val or i + val. This is the graph edges
 *	connecting from this current node to the node i-val and i+val.
 *
 *	Therefore we have to explore the graph and see if we ever encounter the node 0 or not. If yes, then immediately we can
 *	return true.
 *
 *	Do remember that cycle can possibly exist in the graph. Therefore we need a way to record if we had already visited the
 *	graph or not to prevent revisiting a node that is currently already in the midst of visited, and therefore a node
 *	should never be visited twice
 *
 *	Worst case complexity is always O(N) for both space and time. Imagine [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0] and starting at index 0.
 *	Every node has to be explored and recorded.
