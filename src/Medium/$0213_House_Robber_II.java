/*
 * 	A Dynamic programming problem, sequel to the question House Robber I
 * 
 * 	Since the house is now circular, robbing the house N will result in us unable to rob the first house, house 1.
 *  Conversely, robbing the house 1 will result in us unable to rob the last house, house N
 *  
 *  In this case, we can split the problem into 2 problems. Since we are unable to rob both the house 1 and house N
 *  at same time, how about we try to rob as follows:
 *  	From House 1 to House N-1
 *  	From House 2 to House N
 *  and see whoever results in maximum profit. That solves the problem.
 *  
 *  
 *  Trying to solve it without dividing into 2 subproblems are hard. In DP we will lose information of which DP result
 *  involves robbing house 1 or not. Even if we do know, the DP before the last house may end up in all robbing house 1,
 *  only to see that actually reaping the last house with different pattern reaps the most profit.
