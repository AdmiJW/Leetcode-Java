/*
 *  This is a string sorting problem, kind of?
 * 
 *  First thing to observe is that the type of values we have to sort is very small, only 26 possible values. In those
 *  cases, the algorithm we can use is Counting Sort, which counts the frequencies of occurrences, then sort.
 *  
 *  Therefore, obtain the frequency table of characters from str. Then, from the order string, we refer to the frequency
 *  table and append however many we needed to the result string.
 *  
 *  After the order string is done iteration, we can append the remaining characters that are not inside order string. Those
 *  not yet appended character shall still have non-zero frequency in the frequency table.
