/*
 * 	This is a Linked list problem.
 * 
 * 	We are required to only reverse parts of the linked list. Let's see how can we do it.
 * 
 * 	The first thought is to use Stack for the job. Stack is well known for its ability to reverse things.
 * 	Therefore we traverse the linked list, keep a reference of the node just before the section to reverse,
 * 	push everything to reverse into the stack, and also keep a reference to the node after reversal section.
 * 
 * 	Then, if we were to pop the nodes from stack, all of them will be in correct order.
 * 
 * 	Time taken is O(2N), and O(N) space as well.
 * 
 * 	=======================================================
 * 
 * 	Turns out one pass solution also can be done. First we traverse and keep a reference to the node just before
 * 	the section to reverse like above, then for all the nodes that needs to be reversed, we REVERSE THEIR NEXT
 * 	like so:
 * 		(2) -> (3) -> (4)
 * 	to
 * 		(2) <- (3) <- (4)
 * 
 * 	Then, we should have a linked list that looks like this (Assume left = 2, right = 4):
 * 
 * 		(1) -> (2) <- (3) <- (4)  (5)
 * 
 * 	(1) is kept in our reference. (5) and (4) should also be in our variables. (2) is referenced by (1)'s next.
 * 	We have all we need to reverse the list:
 * 		(1) next is set to (4)
 * 		(2) next is set to (5)
 * 	and we are done in one pass! O(N) time and O(1) space
