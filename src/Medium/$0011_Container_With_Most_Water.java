/*
 * 	This is a Array Two pointers question.
 * 
 * 	At first thought, we might want to test out all possible combinations. This way, for each first line, we will try
 * 	out all the possible second lines combinations. This result in O(N^2) time complexity. Can we do better?
 * 
 * 	To do better, we have to make observations! Assume we start at both ends. If we are being smart and greedy, we would
 * 	try to keep the higher line, and move forward the lower one. Keep doing this, and eventually all containers will be
 * 	shrinked and all cases will be tried. Among those cases, there must be a optimum solution inside!
