/*
 * This is a dynamic programming problem.
 * 
 * First of all, what matters more in this problem is the element itself, not the index in the array.
 * Therefore, we convert the array into a frequency table - { element - count }
 * 
 * While obtaining the frequency table, we should also obtain the maximum element which can go up to 10000 only.
 * The maximum element will be useful in DP part later.
 * 
 * ----------------------------------
 * 
 * For DP, we will imagine we have a dp array up until {max} size only. DP[i] will indicate the maximum points
 * that we can possibly earn from considered deleting elements from (0,i].
 * 
 * Therefore, since we will have to remove e-1 and e+1 when we try to earn points from element e, the transition
 * function shall be clearer:
 * 
 * 		dp[i] = max(
 * 			dp[i-1],						// <- If we do not earn from element i
 * 			dp[i-2] + (count of i) * i		// <- If we earn from element i. We cannot get points from element i-1
 * 		)
 * 
 * Using this, Dynamic programming approach shall be clear. Note that since we only use elements from i-1 and i-2,
 * we can space optimize to use only O(1) extra space.
