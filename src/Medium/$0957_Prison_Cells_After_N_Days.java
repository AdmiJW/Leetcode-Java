/*
 * 	This is a type of question where it has a large amount of state transitions (Every day the cell changes), but with a small state space (In other words,
 * 	the possible permutation of the states is small. In this case, only the 6 middle cells seems to be changing. Since the cells can only be 0 or 1,
 * 	the possible permutations are 2^6 which is only 64)
 * 
 * 	Since the state space is small, it must go into a cycle after at most 64 cycles, due to pigeon hole principle. Therefore, we can easily predict the future outcome
 * 	already if it has gone into a cycle, since we already calculated it at least once.
 * 
 * 	By storing the cell states (As string or hashing) into a set and check each time if the cell states is met before, we can easily find the cycle and break the
 * 	iteration. After that, we would just modulo the required times of iteration with the cycle size to see how much steps it'll take to reach the final result.
