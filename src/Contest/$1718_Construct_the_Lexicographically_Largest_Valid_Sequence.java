/*
 * 	This problem turns out to be backtracking problem...
 * 
 * 	We trying to generate the maximum lexicographical array - AKA try to put big values as front as possible
 * 
 * 	However, we are not fixing the value to be insert and trying to move to another position when the position fails.
 * 	This easily results in a non maximum permutation since the fixed value is large, and we are moving it backwards, and
 * 	it may block the next large value from occupying the front spaces.
 * 
 * 	Notice that a solution must be possble. A value must be able to occupy at each space. This guarantee is a big hint
 * 
 * 	Think reversely. Instead of fixing value, we fixing the position and try value from largest to smallest - Greedy.
 * 	Of course, repeated values not allowed. Do Record that
