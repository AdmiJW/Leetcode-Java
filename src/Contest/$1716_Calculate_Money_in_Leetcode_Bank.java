/*
 * 	n <= 1000. Sure we can do it in O(N) time.
 * 
 * 	When we detect it is first day of week, we go back to amount of 7 days ago + 1
 * 
 * -------------------------
 * 
 * 	We could use some arithmetic here. Find out number of weeks and the extra days.
 * 	
 * 	Since on week 2 onwards, it start at 2, 3, 4 and continue... each day amount is +1, therefore total week saved
 * 	is previous week's +7.
 * 
 * 	Use some arithmetic sum formula and can get the answer
