/*
 * 	This is a linked list problem.
 * 
 * 	The most direct way is to store the entire linked list in a random access O(1) data structure to easily gain access
 * 	to any element, and therefore checking each one if they are palindrome or not through classical palindrome checking
 * 	algorithm.
 * 
 * 	The time taken will be O(N) (two passes) but O(N) extra space as well
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Palindrome is nothing but like a mirror at the middle, like: 1,2,3 | 3,2,1. or 1,2,3 |4| 3,2,1.
 * 
 * 	If we are able to reverse one half of it like 3,2,1 | 3,2,1, then checking palindrome is easily done without extra
 * 	space. In fact, we can do it.
 * 
 * 	Using two pointers which one moves 2 nodes at a time, when the fast pointer hits the end, the slow one will be exactly
 * 	at the middle of the linked list. While slow pointer is moving, we can reverse the linked list up until the slow pointer
 * 	simultaneously. 
 * 
 * 	Whether you want to recover the reverse linked list is up to you, as this problem doesn't require it.
 * 
 * 	Time taken is O(N) as well, but space reduced to O(1)
