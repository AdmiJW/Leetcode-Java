/*
 * 	This is a Tree problem, easily solved using level-order traversal.
 * 
 * 	Using a queue, we can easily perform operations in level-wise order. Each iteration, the queue will contain
 * 	all elements in one level. Sum them up, average them, and add to results list
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	However, it is entirely possible using depth first search. In recursion (or Stack), we need to keep track of 
 * 	what levels we are in, and sum them all into one result array as well as update the level element frequency.
 *  At the end of DFS, convert them into average, and return
