/*
 * 	The question is BFS/ DFS question which actually needs to have the results reversed by level, a.k.a from bottom to top.
 * 	For DFS solution, simply call upon a recursive function which takes the level argument as well as the final list which will be returned.
 * 	If the current level had yet to be added to the final list, which can be checked by using the size property, simply add a new list into it
 * 	Lastly after the DFS is done, reverse the list and return the result
 * 
 * 	For BFS solution, we have to know that we don't have to keep track of the level property. After finish searching for a level, the nodes left in the queue is exactly
 * 	all the next level's nodes, therefore for every level we should just iterate queue.size times and upon finishing the search of current level, append it to the result
 * 	list at the head (LinkedList performs better). This also solves the follow up question as for if the tree was streamed and we are unable to use the reverse method.
