/*
 * 	The problem is actually asking:
 * 		>There are 2 types of character available: 1BIT - '0' is allowed, '1' alone is not allowed
 * 												   2BIT - '10' and '11' is allowed. '00' or '01' is not allowed
 * 		>We need to determine whether the last bit, which must be 0, MUST BE 1BIT or not
 * 
 * 		>That boils down to the conclusion: every time you meet a 0 in the sequence, it must be 1BIT
 * 											every time you meet a 1 in the sequence, it must take also the next bit to be '10' or '11'
 *		Using a linear scan until the end, we can see if the last bit is swallowed or not, by looking at the index is on the last bit or exceeded
