/*
 * 	This is a Sorting / Set / Math / Bit Manipulation problem.
 * 
 * 	The brute force solution - For each integer from 0 to N, run a linear scan through the array to check if it exists,
 * 	take O(N^2) time, and is not efficient at all.
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Instead, observe when the array is sorted, ideally it will become 1,2,3,4,5.... Now if one number is skipped, it become
 * 	dead obvious and can be detected easily. This algorithm takes O(N log N) time.
 * 
 * 	We can optimize a bit by using binary search after sorting. Since one number is missing, during binary search if the 
 * 	middle element selected is perfectly matching the index, it means all element to the left is correct. So put left = mid + 1.
 * 	Otherwise, the missing element must be current element or at the left side, so put right = mid
 * 	However, time complexity remains the same.
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	On the other hand, we can use extra space to keep a Set (or boolean array, since index 0 to N only is required), which
 * 	records which element is exist. At the end, run a linear scan again to identify the missing element.
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	All elements are from 0 to N only. Notice how they can be mapped back into the index of the array itself. Also, elements
 * 	are all positive. Therefore, for visited elements, we mark the number at the respective index to become negative. At the
 * 	end, run a linear scan again to check if any element is positive - meaning not visited. If found, the index is the missing
 * 	integer.
 * 
 * 	There are edge cases:
 * 		>	Element 0 cannot be made negative. However, using process of elimination - If all numbers are negative, then 
 * 			the index where element is 0 must be missing!
 * 		>	Indexing only until N-1. We can use one single extra variable to record whether Number N is visited.
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	In a perfect array, the sum will be 1+2+3+...+N. This can easily calculated using formula:
 * 
 * 		(N*(N+1))/2    <<- Using Gauss formula
 * 
 * 	Now, run a linear scan and minus each element from it. The missing number will not be removed, thus at the end of linear
 * 	scan, it will remain, and can be returned.
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	XOR of 2 same numbers will result in 0. Use this fact:
 * 
 * 	If we run a linear scan, all numbers ideally will appear twice: As index, and as element, except Number N, since indexing
 * 	only until N-1.
 * 
 * 	Start out with N, keep XORing the element and the index as we traverse. if a number is missing, indeed at the end what
 * 	remains as result of XOR will be the answer
