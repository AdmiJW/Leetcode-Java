/*
 * 	To avoid finding the number complement one by one, iterating through the array, we use a Hash map to map the number to its index
 * 	If applying 2 passes, we first create a full map by iterating through the array, then, we fix the numbers one by one to try and find its
 * 	complement if it exists in the array
 * 
 * 
 *	Remember that to reach the target given a fixed key, we have to find (target - key)
 *	If it's present in the array, that's it we found the answer (except watch out for duplicate numbers)
 *	If it's not present, that means this is the wrong key and we proceed to attempt the next key
