/*
 * This is an array problem.
 * 
 * First of all, ensure that the reshaped matrix is able to fit all the original array's elements inside, by ensuring the
 * matrix size is the same.
 * 
 * For each of the indices i,j in original matrix, we can use the standard 1D array indexing (imagine the array is flattened)
 * by the formula:
 * 		idx = i * noCols + j
 * 
 * From it, we can then map it into the result array indexing by using formula:
 * 		tr = idx / c			where tr is target row index
 * 		tc = idx % c 			where tc is target column index
