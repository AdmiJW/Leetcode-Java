/*
 * 	This is a classical recursion, dynamic programming problem
 * 
 * 	Although this can be solved iteratively for those who don't have algorithm and data structures background,
 * 	fibonacci numbers itself is recursive in nature. Since to evaluate fib(n), we have to look up previous terms
 * 	until we hit the base case
 * 
 * 	And since there are overlapping subproblems, it can be solved via dynamic programming.
