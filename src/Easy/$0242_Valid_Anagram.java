/*
 * 	This is a Hash map / Sorting problem.
 * 
 * 	Determine if it is anagram simply means to check if frequency of characters in both strings are equal.
 * 	Thus, there are ways to do this:
 * 
 * 	1. Sorting
 * 
 * 	After sort, if the frequency are really identical, both sorted strings shall be identical. Time complexity is
 * 	O(N log N) where N is length of string. Although merge or quick sort takes O(log N) space, usually assumed is O(1) 
 * 
 * 
 * 	2. Hash Table.
 * 
 * 	Use a Hash table to record frequency of characters in both string. At the end, frequency shall match correspondingly.
 *	Furthermore, since there is only 2 strings, we can make one string be adding and the other subtracting. If the
 *	frequencies truly match, at the end the frequencies should be 0.
