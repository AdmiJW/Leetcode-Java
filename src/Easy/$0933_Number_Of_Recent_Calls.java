/*
 * 	This is a Queue problem.
 * 	Given a list of times which we will call ping. We need to know how many pings are made in past 3000 time unit, including the most
 * 	recent one.
 * 
 * 	We will need a way to record the past 3000 time unit ping calls. This is where queue shall be used. In each call to the ping,
 * 	discard all the calls (queue head) which are outdated ( < t - 3000 ). Then push the ping call, and return the size of queue.
 * 
 * 	The time units are in sorted order (increasing). We might be able to instead of popping from the head 1 by 1 (O(N)) time, we might be
 * 	able to perform binary search. However, binary search is not really applicable to linked lists. (Queue).
 * 	One way to get around is by using circular array, where we can actually access elements in O(1) time, and cut off elements also in
 * 	O(1) time. This way the array would be perfect for binary search which is done in O(log N) only.
