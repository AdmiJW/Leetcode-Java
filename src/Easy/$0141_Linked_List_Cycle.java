/*
 * 	This is a Linked List Problem. Optimised solution requires concept of two pointers
 * 
 * 	If a linked list contains a cycle, then there will never be an end (null). Conversely,
 * 	a linked list without cycle will eventually reach null
 * 
 * 	The direct way would be to simply record the seen nodes. How can i check for seen
 * 	nodes in O(1) time? Sets or Maps will do.
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	To do it in O(1) space complexity, it would require Floyd's so-called Cycle Detection Algorithm,
 * 	aka Tortoise and Hare Algorithm. 
 * 	It is a two pointers algorithm which one pointer is faster than the other. 
 * 
 * 	The idea is that, if there is a cycle in the linked list, both pointers will go into the loop, and 
 * 	since both pointers travel at different speeds, eventually the pointers will meet at some point. 
 * 	
 * 	On the other hand, if there is no cycle, then fast pointer will reach to null.
 * 
 * 	The algorithm can be extended to trace back the starting node of the cycle, which requires a bit more
 * 	code. However, it is not needed in this case.
