/*
 * 	This question is solved by iterating through all the grids. If encountered a land, then find out the perimeter associated with this piece of land, where 
 * 	each side facing a water will increase the perimeter by 1.
 * 
 * 	To optimize, since we are iterating from top left corner to the right and eventually until bottom right, and realizing the fact that for a piece of land which
 * 	it has another neighboring island, then the perimeter is already effectively -2 since the neighboring island cannot include the perimeter where it is facing
 * 	with the current island now.
 * 	Therefore when we iterate, we only check the right and bottom islands, and count the number of islands as well as neighbors. After the iteration,
 * 	return islands * 4 (Each island maximum has 4 unit of perimeter, but unlikely if the land is connected) - neighbors * 2 (We count the neighbors of right and bottom only)
 *
