/*
 * 	A greedy problem with HashMap implementation. To build a palindrome with given string, we need to know the
 * 	frequency of each characters in the string. Then, we would build the palindrome with the identical character pairs.
 * 	
 * 	So, after finding out the frequency of characters, iterate through the characters. Add the nearest lower even number of the
 * 	frequency count to the result int (Eg: 59, we would add 58, 24, we would add 24 )
 * 
 *	Lastly, we could include a extra middle value in our palindrome.
 *	If the final count of the palindrome is lesser than the original string length, that means there are extra character we could
 *	place into the palindrome we've built (return res + 1), 
 *	else if palindrome length is equal to original string length, then no extra characters available, just return the full length
