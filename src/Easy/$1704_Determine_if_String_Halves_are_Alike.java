/*
 * 	Easy string problem.
 * 
 * 	Iterate the two halves of the string. Keep a counter to record the numbers of vowels met so far.
 * 	You can use 2 counters for this: 1 for first half, 1 for second half.
 * 
 * 	At the end, if it is alike, 2 counters should equal.
 * 
 * 	Since two counters should end with same amount, c1 - c2 = 0; Therefore, we can use 1 counter only,
 * 	and for first half vowel encounter, we increment the counter. For second half vowel encounter, we decrement
 * 	the counter. At the end, check if the counter are 0.
