/*
 * 	This is a Linked List, Recursion problem.
 * 
 * 	One approach is to reorder the whole linked list using two pointers.
 * 	At a certain point in our program, the two pointers will point to certain nodes in both linked list respectively.
 * 	The pointers initially will be at the head of both linked lists.
 * 	
 * 	The job is to select the lesser one, append it to the tail of newly constructed linked list, and increment the
 * 	pointer. Repeat the process until all nodes are exhausted. Then, we would have a nicely merged sorted list
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Another approach is to do insertion from one of linked list into another linked list. Still, minimum of two pointers
 * 	has to be used to achieve this algorithm.
 * 
 * 	Select the one linked list which starts with lesser value as primary list to iterate, so that we won't need to
 * 	insert nodes from secondary list before the first node.
 * 	The other linked list will become secondary linked list
 * 	
 * 	>	If the pointers to primary and secondary list are not null, 
 * 			-	Primary node is lesser - Proceed the primary pointer
 * 			-	Primary node is greater - Insert secondary node behind the primary node (prev pointer might be needed)
 * 
 * 	>	If primary list is exhausted but secondary list still have nodes yet to insert, It means all remaining secondary nodes are greater than
 * 		primary nodes. Append to the tail of primary list
 * 
 * 	>	Other cases, we can return the head of primary list immediately.
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	This problem also could be solved with recursion. 
 * 	Each recursion call will receive 2 head of linked list. Its job is to find out whoever node is lesser to be returned
 * 	to upper recursion level. However, before doing that, it must ensure it returns a sorted list.
 * 	Therefore,
 * 		>	Select the lesser node out of the two
 * 		>	Call the recursion with 2 of the linked list passed in, but excluding the selected, lesser node.
 * 		>	Append the lesser node to the returned, sorted linked list
 * 		>	Return lesser node
 *
