/*
 * 	A really brute force solution would be checking every possible combination of people going to city A or B. This way would be very
 * 	inefficient and results in time	limit exceeded.
 * 
 * 	An O(n log n) -greedy sorting solution would be to sort every individual differences of going to city A compared to B. In other words, how
 * 	much would I save if I go to city A compared to B?
 * 	Now if the solution is sorted in descending, money saved if this person goes to city A instead of B, and we know exactly N person need to
 * 	go to city A, we would take the first half of the array to A, and the other half to B!

/*
 * 	As usual, this can be done with a dynamic programming solution (But sorting solution has better time complexity)
 * 	
 * 	In the dynamic programming solution, we use a 2D array, where the column will represent NO OF PPL THAT HAS GONE TO B
 * 																  the row represent NO OF PPL THAT HAS GONE TO A
 *  Therefore the array should be a square matrix of N+1 in size, where the rightmost corner represents nobody left to go A or B (N + N = 2N)
 *  
 *  Every move to the right means the candidate goes to city B, and moves downwards means candidate goes to city A.
 *  
 *  For the middle blocks, we would have to select either the candidate goes to A or B, whatever is cheaper
