/*
 * 	This is a classical Dynamic Programming Question.
 * 
 * 	At a particular step, I can choose to go to step i+1, or step i+2
 * 
 * 	Either case, if I know in advance the cost for step i+1 and step i+2 (subproblems)
 * 	to reach the end, then the problem can be solved in O(N) time, because surely, the
 * 	min cost to reach the end from current step is:
 * 
 * 		cost[i] + min( dp[i+1], dp[i+2] )
