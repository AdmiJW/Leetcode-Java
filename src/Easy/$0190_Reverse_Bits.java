/*
 * 	A Direct solution is to start the resulting binary string from 0, and for 32 times, obtain the last bit of the original binary string.
 * 	If the last bit of original is 1, then add 1 to the resulting binary string. Shift the original binary string to the right by one place
 * 	so that we can get the next second bit and so on. Also shift the resulting binary string by 1 place to the left (except when we are
 * 	at the last loop, which we don't have to shift left) so the binary string can be reversed (The last bit is pushed to furthest left).
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	When the function is required to loop many times, it's better to trade space for time complexity. We will use cache.
 * 	First we have to divide the 32 bits into 4 group of bytes. We are going to check if the byte is actually been reversed before so that
 * 	we don't have to reverse the same pattern byte again.
 * 
 * 	To divide the 32 bit into 4 bytes, we need to iterate 4 times, where each time original binary string is shifted right by 8, 16,24 times,
 * 	and masked with 8 1's (255 or 0xFF in HEX) to eliminate the left part exceeding a byte value
 * 
 * 	To reverse a byte is almost the same as above method, but just iterate 8 times (which is 8 bit)
