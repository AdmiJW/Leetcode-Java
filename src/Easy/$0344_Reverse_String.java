/*
 * 	A simple question which simply asks to reverse a string in place (meaning do not make use of other data structures, only manipulate
 * 	datas on the original copy)
 * 
 * 	In place doesn't necessary mean O(1) space complexity, as it can also be done with recursion, which also uses stack memory
 * 
 * 	This is a two pointer problem, we have to keep swapping characters, first one swap last one, second one swap last two, etc... until the midpoint
 * 	
 * 	Either we use left and right pointer with condition (left < right), or just finding the half of the length of string and loop that many times
