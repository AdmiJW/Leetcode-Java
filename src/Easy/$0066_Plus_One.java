/*
 * 	This is a pointer problem. Initialize the pointer to the last node of the array. If by case the number the pointer pointing to is 9, then set it to 0
 * 	and move the pointer left by one node.
 * 	Basically what the pointer is pointing is indicating the node which need to be +1. In case of 9, it will carry forward to the left node to be increment by one
 * 	This process continues until we've met one digit that isn't 9, which can be directly returned
 * 	
 * 	In case it loops until pointer is -1 (Meaning the whole digit given is 999...) then make a new array of size 1 larger than the original, set the head to 1, and
 * 	return it, since 99999... added by 1 will be 100000...
