/*
 * 	This is a HashMap, String problem.
 * 
 * 	A roman numeral convert to integer is quite an easy task. For each of the roman characters,
 * 	simply get its respective value and add to our result variable. It can be done via HashMap
 * 
 * 	One challenges faced is those special '4' and '9's like IV, IX, XL, XC, CD and CM, which are
 * 	4,9,40,90,400,900 respectively. How do we face this?
 * 
 * 	We can actually check two characters at once to see if there is said pair existing in the string.
 * 	However, it can be quite tedious to implement.
 * 
 * 	Instead, observe: Those IV, IX..., the front character is smaller than that of the one behind. Take
 * 	advantage of this characteristic!
 * 	
 * 	Keep a previous value variable, which tracks the value of the roman character in last iteration. Now,
 * 	if current value is larger than the previous one, that means it must be one of special characters!
 * 	Since previous is already added to result in previous iteration, now we subtract two times of that!
 * 	That's it! Solved
