/*
 * 	This is a Two pointers array problem. First attempted in Arrays section. Now revisited
 * 
 * 	No matter if a number is negative or positive, when it is squared, it will become positive regardless
 * 	Therefore it is the MAGNITUDE of the number that is important
 * 
 * 	Notice this sorted array:
 * 			-10, -5, 0, 3, 7
 * 	
 * 	The magnitude starts out large, then become smaller, then eventually after the negative part and arrived
 * 	positive part, it begins to become large again.
 * 	
 * 	Therefore a idea comes to mind. Use two pointer and compare each time: which one is more suited to fill into
 * 	the result array next. The suitable one will have its square inserted, and pointer moved.
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The INSIDE OUT approach utilizes linear scan (or better yet, binary search) to find out the first non negative
 * 	element's index. Then put the 2 pointer:
 * 		Positive pointer: the result of binary search - First non negative element
 * 		Negative pointer: the previous element of the first non negative element must be negative!
 * 
 * 	Now, each time, compare. The one with smaller magnitude, will have the square inserted into res array. Do until
 * 	all elements is inserted
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Upon observation, the both ends of the array are actually large in magnitude. Therefore, we can also initialize
 * 	the two pointers to be point at the maximum magnitude first, and begin shrinking down to center.
 * 
 * 	This means the result array has to be filled reversely. However this elimiates the need of linear scan or 
 * 	binary search
