/*
 * 	This is an array problem
 * 
 * 	Since the cards are all positive, I would want to use up all k available moves to get maximum score.
 * 	However, how many cards from left side and how many from right side is the problem
 * 
 * 	Let's try to obtain all cards from left side first. One by one, I will get one card from right side while
 * 	discarding the leftmost card from left section. Compare the scores to see what maximum score I can get.
