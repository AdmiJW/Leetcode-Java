/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming Problem / Topological sort
 * 
 * 	To find chain of words, we could make use of certain properties to allow faster computation.
 *	First, a word is a predecessor of another if and only if another word is formed by adding one character
 *	to word. Checking for that is done in O(L) time where L is length of string
 *
 *	Say we fix a string s1 and we assume it is a predecessor. We would try to find for string s2 in words which s1 was
 *	predecessor of.
 *	Say we found s2. Problem is, we don't know if s2 can also be predecessor for s3, s4... etc.
 *	
 *	Therefore, what we could do is, knowing the maximum length strings in words couldn't possibly be predecessor for any
 *	other string, their chain is fixed to length of 1 only if they are first element in chain!
 *	This intuition calls for DP approach.
 *
 *	First, sort strings by their lengths.
 *	All of the strings with maximum length can only form chain of length 1.
 *	Then, start iterating shorter strings, and find predecessor in longer lengthed string. If found, simply take the
 *	maximum length chain formed by the longer lengthed string + 1.
 *
 *
 *	------------------------------------
 *
 *	The approach is O(N^2 * L) - For each word, we iterate thru longer strings to find s2 such that this string is predecessor
 *	of it. Performing checking of predecessor is O(L).
 *
 *	But from the problem, L is fixed to 16 which is small. Therefore instead, we could try to use a HashMap where keys are
 *	strings, and values are maximum length of chain. 
 *	For each string, try to insert a character at each possible position. Then, lookup in HashMap.
 *	This way, time complexity is O(N * L^2)
