/*
 *	This is a String Manipulation / Stack Problem
 *
 * 	Given an expression of +-/* and without parenthesis (All operations same layer), how would you calculate
 * 	final answer?
 * 
 * 	One intuition is to do a two pass iteration. On the first pass, we reduce the multiply and division operations
 * 	into one single value, therefore the whole equation becomes only + and - only, which is simple to evaluate 
 * 	in the second iteration.
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	With the Stack solution which is similar in a fashion to two pass string solution, we must notice two things:
 * 		>	When a + or - sign is met, the second operand may be a multiplication or division, which is of 
 * 			higher precedence and be evaluated first. Therefore the first operand must be stored first and
 * 			be taken out to calculate once the second operand side is evaluated.
 * 
 * 		>	When a * or / sign is met, we can immediately evaluate using first and second operand, since no
 * 			parenthesis exists.
 * 
 * 	THe proposed solution is we store the OPERATOR and OPERANDS that we met before, keeping track of current operand
 * 	,and once we met the next operator or hit the end of string, we know we already have the previous and tracked
 * 	operand before this newest operator. Now, what will we do on the past 2 operands?
 * 
 * 			Eg: 		2 + 5 * ...
 * 							  ^
 * 			We will hit this. We know past operator is + and past operand is 2, current operand is 5
 * 
 * 
 * 		>	+ and - : Since the next operand may be higher precedence of * or /, we therefore store the current tracked
 * 			operand, and continue. Note that -x is equivalent to +(-x) thus push -x into Stack instead
 * 
 * 		>	* and / : Immediately perform the operation of two past operands together, push result back into
 * 			Stack, then continue with next operand
 * 
 * 	In the end, the Stack that we store operands on are the ones that we need to sum it up. Return the sum of Stack
 * 	
 * 	===============================================================================================
 * 
 * 	Notice the pattern that the Stack may be redundant after all. With one extra variable, we can store the sum 
 *	of the stack easily.
 *	
 *	Therefore we will basically have 3 variables:
 *
 *			Res		Prev	Curr
 *			( )		( )		( )
 *	
 *	Prev represents the top of Stack, and Res is the sum of all elements underneath the top of Stack.
 *	Therefore the algorithm:
 *
 *		>	+ and - : The previous operand is guaranteed safe from multiplication and division. Sum into Res
 *			and put current tracked number into Prev
 *		
 *		>	* and / : Take prev and current tracked number to multiply / divide. Then put back into prev
 *
 *	
 *	At the end, return Res + Prev;
