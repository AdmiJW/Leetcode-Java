/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming Problem.
 * 
 * 	First of all, the key point to realize is: the array is partitioned into 2 parts of equal in their sum.
 * 	Let the sum be S, then add up the sums of two partition, S, be it S + S = 2S.
 * 	This means the sum of the entire array must be a even number.
 * 
 * 	Next, we can assume the array initially is already in one of partitions. Then, if we decide, we can remove
 * 	this element, E to be moved into another partition. THis will cause
 * 		Partition 1 sum to decrease by N
 * 		Partition 2 sum to increase by N
 * 
 * 	Therefore, if the sum of the partition 2 is increased to N, partition 1 sum must also be reduced to N as well.
 * 	Therefore the nature of problem had reduced to be finding subsequence that add up to S only!
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The idea is, each element we can either have it included in our sum, or not.
 * 	This can come up with a O(2^n) recursion solution, where when the sum is reduced from S to 0 exactly, then
 * 	it is already mean the partitioning is done and satisfied therefore returning true.
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------
 * 
 * 	By using set, we can keep track of each possible sum values formed by each possible element of previous sums.
 * 	THe possible sums for {1} is 1
 * 	THe possible sums for {1,2} is 1, 2, 3
 * 	THe possible sums for {1,2,3} is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
 * 
 *  Each element, we can check if the another term that causes it to add up to S exists in the set or not. If
 *  found, partitioning is entirely possible.
 *  	
 *  1 element generates 1 sum term, 2 element generates 1 + 2 sum term, 3 element generates 1 + 2 + 3 sum term.
 *  Therefore time complexity and space complexity is both O(N^2)
 *  
 *  -----------------------------------
 *  
 *  Let's see Dynamic Programming approach. This is similar to idea of 01 Knapsack Problem where given a bag of
 *  capacity K, find the maximum possible way to select N items each with weight Wi. In this classical problem,
 *  a tabular table where columns represents capacity of bag K from 0 to K, and rows represents the subarray of
 *  N items from {}, {N1}, {N1,N2}...
 *  Basically with each new item introduced in each row, to reach capacity K, we can either include or not include
 *  the item. Therefore just check 
 *  		MAX( not include (last row same col), include (last row, col - weight) + weight )
 * 
 * 	
 * 	By memoization, we use similar tabular method where column is the S, and rows are the indices of element. 
 * 	The grid is a boolean showing if we had tried to compute the similar S at same index of element again. If
 * 	it is true, directly return false back up to recursion stack.
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The real dynamic programming bottom up approach is using tabular array where column is S, and rows are the
 * 	subarrays {}, {N1}, {N1, N2}...
 * 
 * 	Each element we encounter, we try to see if the subarray can achieve sum of S by including or not including the
 * 	introduced element. 
 * 		If not include, take the boolean from last row, same column
 * 		If include, take the boolean from last row, column - Ni
 * 
 * 	
 * 	Notice the DP only uses data from last row. This makes it very possible to compress into 1 dimensional DP
 * 	using space O(N) only.
