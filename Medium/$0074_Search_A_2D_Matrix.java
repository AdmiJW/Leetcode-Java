/*
 *	This is a binary search probelem.
 *
 *	First since the matrix is sorted in both rows and columns, we can first use binary search to narrow down one
 *	row which may contain the target element to find.
 *	This is done by binary searching the first element of the rows. If the first element is greater, then this row couldn't
 *	be the one row containing target, put right = mid - 1. Otherwise, the row could contain the target, so put left = mid.
 *
 *	Next we binary search on the row. This is done as usual way. Finally, check the final value if it is target value.
 *
 *	-----------------------------------
 *
 *	Instead of 2 binary searches, we can do it in one, by binary searching on elements. Given the nth element,
 *	we can know the row and column of it in the matrix by using modulo and division.
