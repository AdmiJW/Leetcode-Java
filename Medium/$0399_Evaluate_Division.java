/*
 * 	This is a Graph / DFS problem.
 * 
 * 	Essentially, the divisions can actually be represented as graph connections. The operands are the nodes, and the result are
 * 	the weight
 * 
 * 	Say A/B = 2, then in graph:
 * 
 * 		   2
 * 	(A) ------> (B)
 * 		<------
 * 		   1/2
 * 
 * 	See it forms a directed graph, but connections must go both way. Essentially from parent node to the next node, the weight is esentially
 * 	meaning: 		PARENT / DESTINATION
 * 
 * 	Now, after graph is formed, we will see in the query. Essentially we are finding a path from the numerator to the denominator. If
 * 	we can find it, then we will know the result. Otherwise, it is impossible and we will return -1
 * 	This is done by DFS + backtracking (Visited set backtracking)
 * 	
 * 	====================================================================================================================================
 * 
 *	It is also possible to solve this via Disjoint sets. The disjoint set tree must have a weight associated with it as well to represent
 *	the result of one node to another... 	
 *
