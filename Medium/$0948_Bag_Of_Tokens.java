/*
 * 	This is a greedy, sorting problem.
 * 
 * 	Given the actions that we could perform on a token:
 * 	>	Flip DOWN the token, so we gain 1 Point but lose token[i] Power
 * 	>	Flip UP the token, so we gain token[i] Power but lose 1 Point
 * 
 * 	If we are facing this choice, we would want to always flip DOWN the least power costly token first, and if needed,
 * 	flip UP only the most power costly token.
 * 
 * 	We will be sorting the tokens, and keep 2 pointers at both ends. On the start pointer is the token we'll most likely
 * 	flip DOWN, and on the end pointer is the token we'll most likely flip UP.
 * 	Keep flipping the token DOWN until we are out of POWER, save the state if it is greater than last score, then
 * 	attempt to flip up until we have enough power again, or run out of scores or token.
 * 	Check at the end of flipping UP, if we have enough power to keep playing. If it's not, then immediately return the
 * 	maximum score.
