/*
 * 	This is a Tree DFS / BFS problem
 * 
 * 	For BFS, we will use level order traversal using Queues. Traverse layer by layer, until we reached
 * 	at the layer d-1. This means we have all the nodes at layer d-1, and we are going to insert new nodes
 * 	at layer d, right below current layer of d-1.
 * 
 * 	For each node at d-1, first keep reference to their childrens. Then, their left and right child will be
 * 	assigned a new node, then, connect the old childrens to the new childrens. That's it.
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	For DFS, use counting down of layer. Once the depth had reached 1, we know that this node at this recursion
 * 	call is a node at d-1. So keep reference to the children, insert new node as direct children, connect the
 * 	old children to the new nodes.
 * 
 * 	Note that special cases is when d=1, which the root of the tree has to be changed. Take care of the special
 * 	case separately.
