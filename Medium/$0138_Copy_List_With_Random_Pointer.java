/*
 * 	This is obviously a Linked List problem, with one solution using HashMap
 * 
 * 	One easy solution is to use a HashMap which maps from original node to cloned node. This way
 * 	when cloning the Linked List, we can know easily whether a node has been cloned before or not
 * 	when assigning next node or random node.
 * 
 * 	O(N) time with O(N) space cost
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Let's try constant space solution. The core problem is able to:
 * 		>	Know a cloned node exists or not
 * 		>	Able to retrieve cloned node in O(1) without going through linked list
 * 
 * 	Given constant space, we can try to modify the Linked List itself! We just have to return it to
 * 	original form before finishing.
 * 
 * 	(A) -> (A clone) -> (B) -> (B clone) -> (C) -> (C clone) ...
 * 
 * 	For each original node, create its clone node, and put it as original node's next. Cloned node's
 * 	next will be the next original node.
 * 
 * 	Then, in another loop, since we know already that original node's next is the cloned node, assigning
 * 	random pointer is easy.
 * 
 * 	Finally, return original linked list back to original state. For each original node, get reference to
 * 	its clone node, then:
 * 		>	Original node will connect back to clone node's next
 * 		>	Clone node will connect to next original node's next (Cloned), if exists.
 * 
 * 	Time is O(3N) but O(1) space complexity
