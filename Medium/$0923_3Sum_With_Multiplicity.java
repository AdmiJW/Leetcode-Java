/*
 * 	If you haven't do the Two Sum problem before, you shouldn't do this first.
 * 	This is a HashMap (Frequency Table), Two pointers problem.
 * 
 * 	What we will try to do is to fix two values, and check if third value, say value at index k, satisfy the condition
 * 	i < j < k, where i and j is the index of first two values.
 * 	Here we will try to fix i and j position.
 * 
 * 	However, note that we can have multiple value occurring in the array, and this is not preferred. Let's convert it into
 * 	a frequency table so we have easier computation. (In this case, it is in range [0, 100] so we could use array)
 * 
 * 	With frequency table, we could attempt to set first pointer i at 0..100. Then, try to set second pointer j but make sure
 * 	it is greater or equal to i!
 * 	Now, where should third value land? It is obtained from target-i-j. Then, first check if k is out of bounds or does not
 * 	satisfy i < j < k. 
 * 	If all ok, then break into cases:
 * 
 * 	>	i == j == k. All three are same values like target=6, and [2,2,2]. Then we have Freq(2) values, and we need to choose
 * 		3. Perform combinations formulae
 * 	>	i == j != k or i != j == k. Like above, we have to choose 2. Perform combinations on 2, while multiply the other.
 * 	>	i != j != k. You know what to do. Multiply these 3 frequencies together
