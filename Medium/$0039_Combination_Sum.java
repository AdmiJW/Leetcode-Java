/*
 * 	This is a backtracking problem.
 * 
 * 	This can be think of in a DP way:
 * 	Given a target integer and list of numbers we can choose from, we can actually pick every number, and have it reduced to a smaller
 * 	subproblem.
 * 	Say we've picked a number 5. Then, we add 5 to our resulting array, and the problem is reduced to target - 5.
 * 	Therefore, we can see that it is more suitable to use recursion to solve the problem in this case. In the recursion function
 * 	the most important thing to pass in is the currently tracked array and the target.
 * 
 * 	Note that the numbers can be repeatly selected, and only COMBINATIONS are allowed ( [1,2] and [2,1] are same, only one of them in solution )
 * 
 * 	First of all, when the target has reached 0, it is the base case where the currently tracked array is exactly one of the solutions. 
 * 	Add the copy of currently tracked array into solution and return.
 * 	Another base case is when the target has gone down below 0. This is a invalid solution so do nothing and return.
 * 
 * 	In general case, we will iterate over the elements of the candidates, starting from the last element selected. To avoid duplicates
 * 	( since only COMBINATION allowed ), we will start iteration from the last selected element's index ONLY. Each element will be selected,
 * 	we will add them to the tracked array, perform a recursive function call, then BACKTRACK by removing the added element.
 * 	
 * 	After the recursive calls, the solution array will be fulfilled, and ready to be returned
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	This is a repeating-allowed case. Solutions like [1,1,1,1,1,...] are entirely possible. Therefore to optimize space, we better use
 * 	a frequency table for that.
 * 	Instead of using a currently tracked array, we use a frequency table. Upon target reaching 0, we will just construct a new List
 * 	and only then begin filling in the elements.
