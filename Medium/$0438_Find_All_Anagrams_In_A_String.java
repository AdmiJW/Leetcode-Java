/*
 * 	My first attempt was writing a helper method and keep the character count of anagram and string seperate, but this would mean everytime
 * 	i move the window, it has to run 26 iterations to check the character map one by one if it has difference (which means the substring is not anagram)
 * 
 * 	Instead, a solution is to keep a difference count and only using one hashmap / bucket
 * 	The bucket works like this:
 * 		-Negative = There is an unwanted character in the window
 * 		-0 		  = Exactly correct amount of this character in the window
 * 		-Positive = The character is needed in the window
 * 
 * 	-Eg : String: abcd, Anagram: abc
 * 	-Initially the map would be {b:1 c:1 d:1} and difference should be initialized to 3, the length of anagram (since window is still at size 0)
 * 	-Now we make the window, after that the map should be {a:-1 b:0 c:0 d:1} and difference is 2, 1 for the excess 'a' and 1 for absence of 'd'
 * 	-After the window moves to 'bcd', the map should become {a:0 b:0 c:0 d:0} and difference is 0. Whenever the difference is 0, that's the substring!
