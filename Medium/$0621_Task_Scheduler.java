/*
 * 	This is a greedy problem.
 * 	Given a list of tasks to execute, where each task executed will have a cooldown time before the CPU can execute the same task again, we need to find the maximum
 * 	time unit required to execute all tasks.
 * 
 * 	Since each task executed will have a cooldown time, then it's best to execute the task with most frequency as soon as possible, and take the gap between to
 * 	execute the second most frequent, and so on...
 * 
 * 	We could first count the frequencies of each task, and sort them based on the frequencies each task appear, with the most frequency at the head of the sorted
 * 	list (like a heap).
 * 	Basically, Following the greedy approach, we can derive a formula that how much spaces that the task will take based on the cooldown interval:
 * 		
 * 				(Frequency) * (n + 1) - n
 * 	(n + 1) is due to the fact that the task also take one unit of time, if n = 4, then T _ _ _ _ << 5 units
 * 	- n is due to the fact that last task will not longer take up cooldown time.
 * 
 * 	However, also notice for the second most frequent task, it will start executing after the most frequent task, at time unit 1.
 * 	Therefore we have to introduce a offset to the formula:
 * 				(Frequency) * (n + 1) - n + offset
 * 	
 * 	Since the intervals are the same, we can actually not do sorting by ignoring those tasks that has less frequency than the max frequency, as they can fit
 * 	into the gaps just fine. The problem arise when the max frequency occur for several different tasks.
 * 
 * 	THerefore we need to apply the offset for the number of times max frequency. If max frequency occurs in 3 different tasks, then we will simply
 * 	calculate the time unit taken, but offset by 2 (Since the third max will start occur at time unit 2)
 * 
 * 	Lastly, the time unit taken must be minimum of the tasks array length. Any time unit below it is impossible. So final result has to be compared with the
 * 	task numbers.
