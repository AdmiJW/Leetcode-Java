/*
 * 	This is a Array String problem.
 * 
 * 	One brute force we can think of is for every word in words[], keep two pointers that pointing to
 * 	index in s and word, and attempt to find subsequence for word by iterating through s.
 * 	This apporach takes O(N * S) time, and results in TLE in leetcode
 * 
 * 	Instead, we can preprocess the string S to store the index sequences of characters beforehand.
 * 	Example: s = "abcaaa", then we store for character a, indices = {0, 3, 4, 5}
 * 
 * 	Then, for each word, we simply keep our progress in the indices. For every character in word, we have to
 * 	look for the next character in indices, but be careful not to take smaller indices that we had already progressed!
