/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming Problem
 * 
 * 	Given maximum moves, we want to know how many ways to kick the ball out of boundary.
 * 
 * 	Let's start up small. Say we only given 1 moves, then the only way is when the ball is at some boundary
 * 	itself. Check the 4 directions, and see if it goes out of bound. If it does, add 1 to the ways
 * 
 * 	Now, move up to 2 moves. Of course, we will still check for adjacent boundaries. However, we can also kick
 * 	it to adjacent grid that are not out of bounds! In that case, once the ball is kicked onto the selected grid,
 * 	I will be left with N-1 moves, right?
 * 	If I know the number of ways to kick the ball out of boundary with N-1 moves on that grid beforehand, I would
 * 	easily obtain the ways!
 * 
 * 	That introduces the Dynamic Programming solution, where we use 2D grid for tabulation! Every move, we simply
 * 	tabulate the number of ways to kick ball out of boundary based on previous tabulated data.
