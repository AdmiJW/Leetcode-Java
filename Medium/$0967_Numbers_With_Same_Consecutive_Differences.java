/*
 * 	This is a DFS / BFS problem with some kind of backtracking element in it.
 * 	
 * 	Before any computation, let's add the base case:
 * 		>	If the N is 1, then 0 will be needed to be included in the answer
 * 
 * 	Now, as the first digit, it can be any digit from 1 to 9. So we iterate through 1 to 9 and attempt to put each one
 * 	as the first one
 * 	Then, we will call upon the recursive function. The recursive function will know that we've selected that digit from
 * 	previous 'seat' and will attempt to find the next possible digit to place, that will give absolute difference to K, that is:
 * 		The next digit, x is greater than the selected digit: X - sd = K		(sd is the selected digit)
 * 															  X = K + sd
 * 		The next digit, x is lesser than the selected digit:  sd - X = K
 * 															  X = sd - K
 * 	Note that if the X is computed to be less than 0 (0 is a valid digit, so is included), or greater than 9, then
 * 	it will be invalid for the case
 * 
 * 	Then, upon selected the digit, we will attempt to use that digit, and call the recursive funciton agian on the next digit to
 * 	be placed
 * 
 * 	Upon reaching the index which is the end of string, then we know we've formed a valid number, thus add it to the result list
