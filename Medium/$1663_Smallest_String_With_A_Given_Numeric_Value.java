/*
 * 	This is a greedy problem. 
 * 
 * 	Think of it as array of characters. Starting from front, if we are able to put 'a' in it, of course we would do it!
 * 	Otherwise if cannot, try 'b', 'c' and so on..
 * 
 * 	So for each space from front, calculate the total value if we were to fill all behind ones with 'z'. Now,
 * 	subtract the currently required value left with the calculated.
 * 	This will give us a picture of what happens if we fill all behind characters with 'z'
 * 
 * 	>	If the answer is negative, it means filling all behind values with 'z' is overkill. Safely insert 'a'
 * 	>	Otherwise, the answer is positive. Fill it in with the character as indicated. If 1, fill 'a', if 2, fill 'b'
 * 		and so on.
