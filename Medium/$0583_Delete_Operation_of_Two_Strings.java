/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming - Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem
 * 
 * 	Given two strings, you only need to find THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CHARACTER TO DELETE TO MAKE THEM EQUAL.
 * 	If you think carefully, before deletion, you will naturally find out the best strategy to delete, which
 * 	is to keep the LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCE OF THEM!
 * 
 * 	Eg: 'abcdefgh' and 'acegz'.
 * 	In this case, 'aceg' turns out to be the LIS of both strings.
 * 
 * 	I won't explain LIS here, for reference, you can go to Topics > Algorithms > Largest Common Subsequence
 * 
 * 	Once found, do some math: 
 * 		>	At the end, both string's length are the result from LIS. In example case above, it's 4.
 * 		>	Therefore, how many characters you have to delete to reduce to both strings be length 4?
 * 		
 * 			len1 + len2 - 2 * LISresult
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	However, a solution without LIS also exists, although it does not run from DP.
 * 	The idea is that the dp grids store the minimum deletions required to reduce both strings to be same instead.
