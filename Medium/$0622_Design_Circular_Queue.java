/*
 * 	This is a design data structure problem - For queue
 * 
 * 	If the two pointers - front and rear of the queue runs out of space after use, then the
 * 	queue is not so efficient. say I have a queue of size 5, I push 5 elements, and pop 5 elements.
 * 	Then the queue should be reusable with 5 space left! 
 * 
 * 	This type of queue is efficient, and is called "Ring Buffer", where last position of the queue is
 * 	essentially connected back to the first position in the queue.
 * 
 * 	Turns out, it is easily done via two pointers and a modulus operation. Say my queue is of size 5,
 * 	and the rear pointer is now at index 4 (last position). If I want to enqueue some elements, the
 * 	next index to work on is actually just (i+1) % 5, where 5 is the capacity of the queue. WIth this,
 * 	I get back index 0, which is start of queue! (Just check if the queue is full or not so we don't
 * 	overwrite useful data).
