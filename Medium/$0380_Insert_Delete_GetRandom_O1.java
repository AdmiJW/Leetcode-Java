/*
 * 	The basic idea is to use an array list and a hash map. 
 * 	The hash map stores the value as key for direct look up whilst the value is the position of it in the array list.
 * 	The array list is used for obtaining a random value using its index (since rand() generates from 0 to n-1). It maps from index to the value
 * 	itself
 * 
 * 	Initially I used another Set to store deletedIndex every time the delete method is called. However this results in extra space and probably
 * 	result in longer time when getRandom() method is called as it has to keep iterating for the random number which isn't in the Set. Additionally,
 * 	to access the elements in the set I have to use iterator which needs to be updated every time the set is changed.
 * 
 * 	Another better idea is to use Overwriting. Every time the delete is called, the element in the array list is overwritten with the last element in
 * 	the array list. Then the array list remove( size - 1) method is called upon the last index, which uses only O(1) time because no shifting is done.
 * 	The only extra thing to do is to update the value to index mapping in the hash map.
