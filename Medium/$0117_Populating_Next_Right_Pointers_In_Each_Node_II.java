/*
 * 	This is a Tree BFS / DFS problem. The hard part is to solve it in O(1) space 
 * 
 * 	The most easiest implementation is to use Queue to perform level order search. At each iteration,
 * 	the nodes at the same level should all be placed in Queue. Taking note of the number of nodes in the
 * 	queue, pop them out and connect one to the next, except the last one. Also push the child nodes into the
 * 	queue as well for next level iteration (Be careful not to connect across levels!)
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	To avoid using Stack, we should use the fact that from top-down, the upper level must all have the next
 * 	pointer already populated. How would we use the upper level's next pointer to aid us in connecting the nodes
 * 	in current level?
 * 
 * 	For DFS solution, preferably we should always encounter the leftmost node in the level, and upper level
 * 	has all next pointer populated. In that way:
 * 		
 * 		As soon as we encounter a node, check if the node's rightmost child node is connected or not. If not,
 * 		start the connection process across the whole level.
 * 		This is done by using the fact that current node has the next pointer already populated. Using loops,
 * 		find the next closest node to connect.
 * 		Once connected, this is not finished. We shouldn't leave the connection done halfway in a level. Set
 * 		current node to that closest node, and continue the process until hit the level's end.
 * 
 * 	Then, we recurse on the lower nodes, knowing this level connection is established, it is safe to recurse.
 * 
 * 	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	The most ingenious solution is using the concept of linked list. 
 * 
 * 	Start from top level - Level 1.
 *  
 * 	While the node is not null:
 * 	
 * 		Set up a linked list equivalent structure for the level:
 * 		>	Create a dummy node, and set tail to be dummy node.
 * 		>	While node is not null, then
 * 				if node left exists, connect it to linked list, and update tail
 * 				then
 * 				if node right exists, connect it to linked list, and update tail
 * 			Once done, proceed to the node's next
 * 
 * 		>	Once the node hit null, it means the level is done traversing. How do we go to the next level's
 * 			leftmost node? Notice the dummy node is head of linked list, and the leftmost node is connected
 * 			next to head! Go to it!!!
