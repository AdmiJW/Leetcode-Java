/*
 * 	The problem is actually solved best using brute force?
 * 
 * 	Given base integers x and y, we have to find out sums that are less than bound.
 * 	First, the results store in Set, so that at the end, no duplicate answers are present.
 * 
 * 	Given x, we run a outer loop which goes over all possible power of x, from 1 onwards.
 * 	The same goes for y. 
 * 	However, be careful if the base is 1, since 1 to power of anything remains 1, it easily causes
 * 	infinite loop.
 * 
 * 	Instead of this approach, you may also determine the BOUNDS of power of x and y, via logarithms
 * 	
 * 	Since x increases at multiplying rate, outer loop takes logarithmic time. Inner loop for y is
 * 	same, so complexity is approximately
 * 		O(logx(bound) x logy(bound) )
