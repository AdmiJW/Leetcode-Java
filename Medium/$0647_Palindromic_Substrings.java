/*
 * 	As usual, this is a Dynamic Programming problem / Palindrome technique problem
 * 
 * 	First solution to use DP, is to observe a palindrome pattern and relate how to determine if a substring is a
 * 	palindrome based on previously computed results
 * 
 * 	>	A substring is palindrome if:
 * 			-	First and last character is same
 * 			-	The middle part (exclude the first and last) is also a palindrome.
 * 
 * 	If we already determined if the middle part is palindrome before, we could solve it in DP in O(N^2) time
 * 
 * 	Thus we use a DP array of size 2D. Rows indicate the start index of substring, and column indicate the end index
 * 	of substring. 
 * 	To fill in DP array, we make nested loop - Outer one loops length, and inner loops start index (and thereby identify
 * 	end index as well). 
 * 	Base case is that all substring of len 1 is a palindrome. Then we loop length 2, 3...
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	"Palindrome is like a onion. Remove head and tail character, and end up with another smaller palindrome"
 * 
 * 	Therefore, we can iterate over all centers in the string, and attempt to extend the window and see if it is still a
 * 	palindrome or not.
 * 
 * 	For this we have to consider whether the palindrome is odd length and even length. Thus, iterate all indices and
 * 	find out whether this is a center of palindrome at [i,i] and also [i,i+1] (Even length palindrome)
