/*
 * 	This is mainly a Stack + Greedy problem.
 * 
 * 	Given a string consists of only lowercase alphabets. Return a string of max size 26 such that:
 * 	>	Remove all duplicate letters, such that only one of each alphabet remains in the result
 * 	>	The order of original string mustn't be altered
 * 	>	Among all possible answers, it must have LOWEST LEXICOGRAPHICAL ORDER
 * 
 * 	That means, If say we have alphabets [a,b,c] in our string. If we have a 'a', and after 'a' we know there is a 'b',
 * 	then only we can safely use this 'a' in our result.
 * 	On the other hand, if the 'a' doesn't have any 'b' following it (Meaning that all the 'b' are in front of 'a'), then
 * 	we have no choice but to use 'b' in front of 'a'
 * 	We shall always try to be greedy, and put the lowest lexicographical alphabet in front of everything.
 * 
 * 	How do we able to know if there is a 'b' remaining after the 'a'? We can simply keep some information on the positions
 * 	of the letters, or even better, FREQUENCIES.
 * 	On iteration, we will keep a frequency counter. Whenever we meet a character, the counter goes down by 1. Whenever
 * 	the counter still is larger than 0, that means there are this character behind the current position.
 * 
 * 	The action is: to try and keep adding the characters to the Stack ( Remember to add only if the character is never
 * 	used before!). 
 * 	When the stack's top has HIGHER lexicographical order than the current character to be inserted, check the top character's
 * 	frequency left. If there is still that same character left in behind part, then safely pop it out. Keep popping until
 * 	either stack is empty or the top is LOWER lexicographical. THen only we add the character.
 *
