//https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/

/*
 * 	A greedy problem, with quite a bit of logic and thinking.
 * 	We have to sort the array firstly based on the height of the people themselves, in descending order. 
 * 			Eg: 7,0 -> 6,1 -> 5,2 -> 4,3 ....
 * 
 * 	For those who have the same height, we have to sort them based on how many people in front of them, in ascending order
 * 			Eg: 7,0 -> 7,1 -> 7,2 -> 7,3 ....
 * 
 * 	(It kind of makes sense if you think about it)
 * 
 * 	Now we have to check each one of them. For the people standing in index i, there is ALSO i people standing in front of it (There's importance
 * 	of k kicking in).
 * 	If the people we're checking has a value k that is less than its index i value, that means this people is behind its supposed standing place.
 * 	We have to shift it to the left.
 * 	Here's the wonder: No matter how we shift it to the left, k value of all the people to the left wouldn't be really affected (unless you are
 * 	shifting left to the person of same height, but that wouldn't really happen if done correctly since we've sorted in ascending order of k)
 * 			Eg: 7,0 -> 6,1 -> 5,0			Since clearly, the 3rd person has 2 higher people in front of it but the k value is 0, therefore
 * 											we have to shift it to the left by (index) - (k val) = 2 times.
 * 				5,0 -> 7,0 -> 6,1			Notice that after shifting, other people k value respective to height still hold firm. This is because
 * 											height 5 was initially already lower than those people!
