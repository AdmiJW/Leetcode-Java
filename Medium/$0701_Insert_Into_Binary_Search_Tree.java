/*
 * 	This is a simple Binary Search Tree Insertion Question.
 * 
 * 	When we insert an element into a normal BST (Not balanced), it will usually be added as a leaf node.
 * 	This is quite of a recursive problem to it, we are repeating asking one question:
 * 	>	Should I insert a node in this current node?
 * 
 * 	Therefore this problem can be solved recursively, or iteratively.
 * 
 * 	Remember the property: Left subtree always has all values less than the current node,
 * 						   Right subtree always has all values greater than the current node.
 *	Therefore at each node, we compare the value to insert with the node's value, to determine whether
 *	the inserted node shall go into left side or right side
 *
 *	WHen approaching recursively, each child node of current node is considered the root node in that
 *	recursion call. When the root node is null, simply create a new node with the value and return.
