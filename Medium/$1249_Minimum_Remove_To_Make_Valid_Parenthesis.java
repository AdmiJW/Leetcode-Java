/*
 * 	This is a Stack / Two pointers solution.
 * 	
 * 	For each of the opening parenthesis that we meet, it would need a corresponding closing parenthesis to be valid. Otherwise,
 * 	that opening parenthesis need to be discarded.
 * 
 * 	To use Stack, we push all the indexes of the '(' into the stack, and pop the top when see one ')'. If the stack is empty when
 * 	we see a ')', that means for a unmatched ')', so record that as well in some appriopriate data structure.
 * 
 * 	-----------------------------
 * 
 * 	Instead of using Stack, we can further reduce the space complexity.
 * 	Observe that for each opening parenthesis, we would want to be greedy and use the closest closing parenthesis to the right.
 * 	Next time another opening parenthesis is met, we would continue searching for the next closing parenthesis wihtout
 * 	repeating checking. This method utilizes two pointers.
 * 
 * 	Keep track of how many valid closing parenthesis is used, so when we met ')', we know if we can put that closing parenthesis
 * 	or not.
 * 
 * 	Time O(N) and space of O(1) if not consider stringBuilder as extra space.
