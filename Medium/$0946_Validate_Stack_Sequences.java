/*
 * This is simply a Stack question.
 * 
 * Each iteration, I can do the following only:
 * 	>	If stack empty or stack top is not equal to current pop element, then push the next element
 * 	>	Otherwise, pop the top of stack as the pop element is same as stack top
 * 
 * If successfully iterate over all of the pop elements, then return true.
 * If ran out of elements to push, then return false.
 * 
 * Time complexity is O(2N). Each element is operated twice - push and pop
