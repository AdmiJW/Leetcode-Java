/*
 * 	This is a DP / Trie problem.
 * 
 * 	The first approach is to use pure Trie.
 * 	First, we will construct the Trie of the entire wordDict. Remember to mark the end of word with the boolean isWord
 * 	To avoid using recursion, we can use any data structure (Stack or queue or any stuff that can be easily emptied and refilled)
 * 	to store POINTERS to TrieNodes.
 * 
 * 	The idea is as follows:
 * 	>	Each new character introduced, there is either 2 roles played by this character:
 * 		-	The start of a new word. But for this to be valid, the previous character must be the last character of a valid dictionary
 * 			word
 * 		-	The next character of a currently tracked dictionary word. In other words, it is a middle part (not starting) of a dictionary
 * 			word
 * 
 * 	>	To deal with case 1, use a boolean flag to indicate whehter the previous character is the end of a valid dictionary word.
 * 		This way when a new character is introduced and boolean flag says true, then we can check from the root whether this character
 * 		can form a new word.
 * 	>	To deal with case 2, we use the data structure to keep pointers of currently tracked words. Each character, we will basically empty
 * 		out the data structure (Iterating them), If the trie node contains the currently introduced character, push the next trie node
 * 		into the data structure
 * 
 * 	Worst Case is when the pointer becomes as many as the length of the dictionary. In that case, the time complexity is
 * 	O(NK) where N is length of the string and K is length of the dictionary
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Another real DP solution. The core idea is:
 * 		We can record a dp array of booleans. The boolean indicate whether the substring starting from index 0 until that index is
 * 		a valid work break or not.
 * 
 * 	With every character introduced, we will check if this character is the last character of a dictionary word. This checking can be
 * 	easily done if we keep a REVERSED TRIE (Words stored in reverse). If it is indeed a dictionary word, then we also need to check
 * 	before the current word if it is a valid word break or not.
 * 	Only if these 2 conditions are fulfilled, we can put TRUE into the dp array.
 * 	At the last index of dp array stores the overall answer to the problem.
 * 
 * 	Time complexity is O(NL), where N is the length of the string, and L is the length of longest dictionary word
