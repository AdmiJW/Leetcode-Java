/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming Problem.
 * 
 * 	We want to find out the minimum path sum. So what we could do is to perform depth first search from the
 * 	tip of triangle as the root.
 * 	The problem with this is, if we were to visualize the tree formed, there were overlapping subproblems:
 * 	a node may be visited twice from the parent. Therefore, we shall eliminate this computational cost via
 * 	utilizing the space: DP
 * 
 * 	DP uses bottom up approach. So initialize a 2D DP array which each grid actually maps to a node in triangle itself.
 * 	The base case is that at the bottom of triangle, the minimum is always the node value itself.
 * 
 * 	For each non-bottom node, it can explore bottom left and bottom right, therefore the formulae is
 * 			node val + MIN( dp[i+1][j], dp[i+1][j+1] )
 * 	At the end, return the dp array's tip of the triangle, consisting of minimum path from top to bottom of triangle
 * 
 * 	------------------------
 * 
 * 	Notice how the DP only uses the next row in dp array, this opens up possibility to save space by using only 1D array.
 *
