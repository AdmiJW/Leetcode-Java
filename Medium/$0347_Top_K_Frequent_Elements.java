/*
 * 	HEAP + HASH MAP
 * 
 * 	A simpler way to solve this question is to use Heap and Hash Map combination. Remember that heap has a property to be always available
 * 	to poll out the max/ min value of the data.
 * 	Therefore we would first count the frequencies of the numbers in the array first. Then, we would add them into the heap.
 * 	The better choice to be done here is to only maintain the size of heap to be k size. Then it won't consume up as many space as needed.
 * 	We create a heap with custom comparator which sorts by comparing the frequency count of both from frequency table. Then, when the 
 *	size of heap overflows when we had just added new integer into it, we would just poll out the number with smallest frequency from it.
 *	Lastly, just poll out all the numbers from heap and put it into result array.
 *
 *	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *	QUICK SELECT / PARTITIONING
 *
 *	Another solution is to use the Partitioning technique from Quick Sort Algorithm, which can be quite efficient when dealing with
 *	'Find k largest/ top k...' Problems.
 *
 *	It basically finds a pivot, and scan through the range with one fast pointer and one slow pointer.
 *	From fast pointer, any integer that has smaller frequency than the pivot's shall be swapped with the slow pointer, which
 *	the slow pointer will also be move forward by one step.
 *
 *	To prevent the pivot from being swapped, set the pivot to be the end of the list, and loop until the previous element of the pivot.
 *
 *	At the end, the slow pointer will point at the place where the pivot integer is supposed to be. Swap the pivot and the integer where slow
 *	pointer is pointing to. 
 *	Now, the slow pointer is the point where every integer to the right is larger than the integer at pivot, and every integer to the left
 *	is smaller than the integer at pivot. Calculate the length of subsequence to the right, if it matches with the requested k large elements,
 *	then just return that subsequence (Since question noted that arrangement doesn't matter)
 *	If it doesn't, we would just use binary search technique, narrow down the range of either right pointer or left pointer, and
 *	repartition until we've found the exact subsequence length.
 *
 *	The worst case is if the pivot is always belong to the end of the array (The array is already sorted), resulting in
 *	worst case O(n^2) time complexity. However on average, it shall be O(N).
 *	To minimize the worst case probability, we could randomly select the pivot from the array and swap it with the last element before
 *	the partitioning process, which can further reduce the probability of selecting worst pivot again and again.
