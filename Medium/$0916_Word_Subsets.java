/*
 * 	This is a String problem, a not so direct question
 * 
 * 	If we were to do brute force, for every word in A, we compare with B. If say b in B is a subset of A, then the frequency
 * 	of characters in a must at least equal to that in b. We are comparing frequency of characters here.
 * 
 * 	However, brute force will result in time limit exceeded due to each array can reach length 10000. Is there better way?
 * 
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Notice that we want every pattern in B to be subset in A. Therefore, since there is only 26 lowercase letters, we can combine
 * 	the entire strings in B to reduce to only one universal pattern string, such that:
 * 		
 * 		If string a in A matches the universal pattern string, then all b in B must be subset of A.
 * 
 * 	Combining them is easy. Iterate over all b, count frequency, and have one frequency table which represents the universal
 * 	string, always take the maximum for each frequency.
