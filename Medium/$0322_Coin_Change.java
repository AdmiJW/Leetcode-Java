/*
 * 	This is a Dynamic Programming question.
 * 
 * 	From that given amount, we can make multiple choices from the available coins. Once we have selected one coin value,
 * 	the problem is reduced to a subproblem: Find the coinChange for amount-c, where c is the selected coin value.
 * 
 * 	Therefore, we could use DP to solve this. One way is to use bottom up approach, where the base case is amount = 0, which
 * 	requires no coin at all (ans = 0). Then, proceed to evaluate amount = 1, 2... and so on.
 * 	In each amount, we iterate over all coin values, and look back at the memoized amount-c solution, and we plus 1 to it.
 * 	At the end, the answer will be right at dp[amount];
 * 
 * 	------------------------------------------------
 * 	
 * 	Not only bottom-up, but top-down approach is of course plausible. Have a hashMap to help record the past evaluate amounts.
 * 	In each recursive call, if amount is seen before, return immediately, otherwise you have no choice but to evaluate, but 
 * 	remember to record it in HashMap after evaluating so that in the future you won't have to perform repeated calculations!
