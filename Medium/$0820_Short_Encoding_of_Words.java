/*
 * 	This is a Suffix / Trie problem
 * 
 * 	Notice that every string s in the array of strings, we will try to traverse as far as we can go into the trie.
 * 
 * 	The trie will be a suffix tree, due to the fact that if A is a suffix of B, like A = "le" and B = "apple", A
 * 	will not count towards the result count, due to it being inclusive in app"le"
 * 	
 *  Once we stop at one point where we can't continue due to non-existent trie node, or exhausted the string itself, it can 
 * 	be reduced to following cases:
 * 
 * 		>	String itself is exhausted. That means the string is entirely a suffix of another string. Do nothing
 * 		>	Ended at a node which don't have any child nodes. That means we will be simply extending the current string.
 * 			Eg: Trie contains "le" and we trying to insert "apple". In this case just add 3 to result, due to prior to
 * 				this, le# is already counted.
 * 
 * 		>	Ended at a node which have child nodes. In that case the matched string is for entirely different string,
 * 			Eg: "idle" and we are trying to insert "apple". In this case, "apple" cannot be included in "idle", thus
 * 				we need to create a entirely new part for this string, resulting in
 * 				"idle#apple#
