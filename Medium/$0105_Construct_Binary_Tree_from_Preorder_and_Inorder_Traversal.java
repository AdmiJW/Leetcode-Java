/*
 * 	This is a Tree, DFS problem.
 * 
 * 	Problems that goes with tree, are often better solved with recursion. Similar case applies here.
 * 	First, remind that
 * 		>	Preorder: Root > Left > Right
 * 		>	Inorder: Left > Root > Right
 * 
 * 	When we first receive both arrays, we must realize the fact that:
 * 		>	In preorder, first element must be the root of whatever tree we are building.
 * 		>	Then, knowing the root node, we can check where the current root node is located in the
 * 			inorder traversal.
 * 
 * 			Once located, new information will be exposed to us by looking in Inorder traversal:
 * 
 * 					Left subtree nodes			 Right subtree nodes
 * 					<------------------- ( ROOT ) -------------------->
 * 
 * 	Therefore, we have successfully divided the problem into smaller subproblems to be solved by our
 * 	imiginary recursion function!
 * 	
 * 	In my solution, I pass the left and right limit of both inorder and preorder traversal arrays to
 * 	indicate the range of nodes that are included in the subtree.
 * 
 * 	However, turns out we actually don't need to impose the right limit on preorder array, due to
 * 	the recursive function only checks for the first element and nothing else. Also we can simply
 * 	check whether it is invalid left and right limit for inorder traversal to determine base case.
