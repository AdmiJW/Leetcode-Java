/*
 * 	To reverse a linked list, an O(n) approach is that:
 * 		You know initially, the head of the linked list is always going to end up at the tail of the resulting linked list. Therefore, using the head as our pivot,
 * 		we keep moving the pivot's next node to the head, until the pivot is at the end of the list (next points to null)
 * 
 * 	To move the pivot's next node to the head, we need to do several things:
 * 		- Connect the pivot to the next node's next node.
 * 		- Let the pivot's next node to connect to the head
 * 		- Update the head pointer to the pivot's next node
 * 
 * 	Iterate this above algorithm until the pivot's next is null
 * 
 * 
 * 	Another approach is to reverse the arrowhead instead of moving the nodes itself to the head.
 * 	We know for the fact that initially the linked list head must end up pointing at null at the resulting array. Therefore
 * 	first we keep the reference of the node's next, and point the node's next to the previous node (initially as null).
 * 	
 * 	Now update the previous to the node you just processed, and update the current node to be processed to the reference we kept in the first hand
 * 
 * 	Iterate until the current node to be processed is null, which we will return previous node as the head of linked list
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 	As for the recursive approach of reversing arrowhead, We will first obtain the end node of the linked list, which will be the head of resulting array.
 * 	After doing it recursively, we will start from the bottom up approach, by starting to reverse the arrows from the second last node.
 * 	Point the current next node's next pointer to current, then the current's next pointer to null. Then return the end node.
